    "**Goal for this Notebook**\n",
    "- Prepare a dataset to fine tune a model for L1 (Chapter) level classification. The reason for fine-tuning at a 'higher' level is to eliminate challenges assocaited with the long-tail problem. This exercise will fine tune a model for multi-label classification with 17 label options.\n",

    "<small>[_Click here for a complete list of ICD9 Chapters_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ICD-9_codes)</small>\n",

    "**Approach**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The dataset will be created using the ICD9 code tree to create descriptions for chapter classifications. For example, for a single chapter we can create many rows for training by using the ICD code name, child code names, and supplement information from UMLS.\n",
