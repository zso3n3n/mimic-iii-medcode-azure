### üìí Notebooks

‚î£ **00 EDA** - Get familiar with the MIMIC-III / ICD9 dataset. Explore the challenges with AI based medical coding via the MIMIC-III dataset  
‚î£  **01 Azure Text Analytics for Health**  - Parse medical notes into medical concepts. Supplement medical concepts with synonyms and definitions  
‚î£  **02 LLM Extraction**  - Use an LLM to extract _only_ the relevant components of a medical note  
‚î£  **03 Heirarchical Medical Coding** - Model ICD9 codes as a tree to limit the code label space. Use an SLM (small language model) to do many small classifications recursively  
‚î£  **04 Fine-Tuning** - Prepare a dataset for supervised fine-tuning. Fine-tune a GPT model for multi-label medical coding

### ‚öïÔ∏è Data
Data for this analysis is from the semi-open [MIMIC-III Clinical Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/). **The data is not permenantly stored in this repository.** To access the data, follow the steps on the linked website and complete the necessary trainings. This data is for research purposes only.

To run the repository code download the data to a data/ in the home directory. The following files are used:
<small>
- D_ICD_DIAGNOSES.csv.gz
- DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv.gz
- DRGCODES.csv.gz
- NOTEEVENTS.csv.gz
</small>  

Once you have accessed the MIMIC-III data set, prepare the data using the [prepare_mimic_iii.py](./src/prepare_mimic_iii.py) script provided in this repo.   
  
The ICD9 Code heirarchy is represented in the [icd9_codes_full.json](./icd9_codes_full.json) file. This file is permenantly stored in the repo.

### üîß Setup
To run this repository, follow the steps below to setup dependencies and environment variables.

1. Follow the steps in the above "Data" section to get access to the MIMIC-III dataset.

2. Follow the steps linked here to get access to the [UMLS API](https://documentation.uts.nlm.nih.gov/rest/home.html)

3. Setup the required resources in Azure:
    - [Azure Open AI Resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?msockid=359b98bc5ab160c83b508c325bd061fd)
    - [Azure AI Language Resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-language?msockid=359b98bc5ab160c83b508c325bd061fd)

4. Setup conda virtual environment
