CLINICAL INDICATION: A Age over 90 -year-old woman with right comminuted fracture of the right iliac Doctor First Name 2805 and a nondisplaced fracture of the os pubis with evidence of active extravasation into the pelvic hematoma on CT angiography of the pelvis for possible embolization of bleeding artery. Informed consent for the procedure was obtained after risks potential complications and benefits of the procedure had been discussed with the patient. The patient was placed on the angiographic table in supine position. The huddle and timeout protocols were carried out prior to the procedure according to the Hospital 51 Hospital policy. ANESTHESIA: Local. MODERATE SEDATION: The procedure was performed under monitored conscious sedation. The patient received a total quantity of 1 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl during the total procedural time of two hours while her hemodynamic parameters and pulse oximetry were continuously monitored by a trained radiology nurse. PROCEDURE: After generous infiltration of 1% lidocaine left common femoral artery was punctured using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. Over a 0.018 guidewire the micropuncture needle was exchanged for a 4 French sheath followed by placement of 0.035 Bentson guidewire into the infrarenal abdominal aorta. A 5 French Balkan sheath was advanced into the proximal left common iliac artery and over the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta into the proximal right common iliac artery. Through the endovascular sheath a straight Flush catheter was advanced into the proximal right common iliac artery. Right common iliac arteriogram in three anatomical projections demonstrated no active arterial extravasation.

Serologies are O negative hepatitissurface antigen negative hepatitis C positive RPRnonreactive antibody negative rubella immune GBS unknown.other living children. This was a spontaneous twinpregnancy. Mother reports normal amniocentesis and normalsecond trimester ultrasound. The pregnancy was going wellwithout complications until the morning of 2120-3-9 at 7:30 whenthe mother reported spontaneous rupture ofmembranes twin two. She presented to Labor & Delivery fromthe Emergency Room. The mother was noted to be in earlyAmpicillin and Erythromycin and was given one dose ofbetamethasone at 1300 2120-3-9. She was latertransferred to the floor. Early a.m. 2120-3-10 mother found tohave progressive cervical dilatation and the decision wasmade to deliver twins by cesarean section. Mother was unableto get effective spinal anesthesia and was placed undergeneral anesthesia. This infant's membranes ruptured at thetime of delivery. The infant emerged with decreased activityand no spontaneous respirations. He was bulbed suctioneddried stimulated and give positive pressure ventilation. Heresponded well but did have progressive respiratory distressconsistent with a respiratory distress syndrome. Thepatient's CPAP was started and he was intubated prior totransfer to the MICU with improvement of aeration and color.Apgars were 5 and 7.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Weight 1080 50thpercentile. Length 37 cm 25 to 50th percentile. Headcircumference 26 cm 50 to 75th percentile. Anterior fontanelopen and flat pink well perfuse no rashes. Skin intact.Positive red reflexes bilaterally. Equal chest excursionwith retractions poor aeration consistent with a respiratorydistress. Skin extensive bruising throughout. Normal S1 andS2. No murmurs. 2+ pulses. Abdomen withouthepatosplenomegaly three vessel cord. Normal externalgenitalia for a preterm male. Spine straight intact. Patentanus. Infant tone appropriate for gestational age.HOSPITAL COURSE: Respiratory: The patient had increasedrespiratory distress requiring intubation andtreatment with Surfactant times two. He extubated to CPAP by24 hours of age and is continued on CPAP with brief periodsof trials off up until day 47 2120-4-16 at which time hewas extubated to room air. He has been stable withoutincrease in apnea and bradycardia spells. He was started oncaffeine citrate for management of apnea and bradycardia onday of life one and continues on caffeine citrate currentlywith good management. On average has one to three apneabradycardia spells per day.Cardiovascular: Initially required normal saline bolusestimes two and Dopamine at 7.5 micrograms perkilogram per minute for management of hypotension. He weanedoff his Dopamine by 24 hours of age and has beencardiovascularly stable throughout remainder of hospitalcourse with no history of a cardiac murmur.Fluid and electrolytes: His birth weight was 1080. He wasinitially started on 80 cc per kilo per day of D10W. Herequired a D10 bolus on admission for hypoglycemia. He hashad no further issues with hypoglycemia. He started enteralfeedings on day of life number one advanced to full enteralfeedings by day of life eight and has been stable on 150 ccper kilogram per day max of PE 30 with ProMod. He iscurrently receiving 150 cc per kilogram per day of PE 26demonstrating good weight gain. His discharge weight is2055.

He received doublephototherapy times three days decreased single phototherapyand phototherapy was discontinued on day of life eight with arebound bilirubin of 3.10.3. This issue has been resolved.Hematology: Hematocrit on admission was 54.6. His mostrecent hematocrit on 2120-4-18 was 30.8. He has notrequired any blood transfusions during this hospital course.Infectious disease: A CBC and blood culture was obtained onadmission. CBC was benign. The culture remained negative at48 hours and Ampicillin and Gentamicin were discontinued. Onday of life five the infant increased with apnea andbradycardia spells had a temperature of 101. At that time aCBC was obtained. CBC was benign. Blood cultures werepositive for staph aureus. The infantwas treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin for a total ofthree days and then changed to Penicillin and Oxacillin for atotal of a seven day course. Antibiotics were discontinuedon 2120-3-23 and he has not had any further issueswith sepsis during this hospital course.Neurological: Head ultrasound was performed on day of lifeone four and 30 days all within normal limits.

Patient may have and aspiration pneumonia as he already has a history of this. Also possible that patient has hospital acquired pneumonia. Feasible to cover for legionella with levofloxacin prior to rule out with legionella urinary antigen. UA in the ED was positive for bacteria WBCs and leuk est. Should send urine culture to follow this. Blood cultures from ED are pending. Lactate at presentation was 1.0. - Antibiotic regimen of Vancomycin Zosyn Levofloxacin - Sputum culture if able - Urine culture - Stool culture - Follow-up pending blood cultures - Repeat lactate this afternoon - Speech and swallow evaluation prior to discharge # Hypotension: Likely sepsis physiology and related to above infectious work-up however some consideration given to cardiac etiology of hypotension. Patient with unchanged EKG in the ED from baseline and no complaints of chest pain. First set of cardiac enzymes was negative. Likely no need to continue rule out for MI. - Support blood pressures with fluid boluses and consider need for pressors - Arterial line for closer monitoring - Consider central venous line # GI bleed: Both coffee ground emesis and guaiac but no grossly positive stools point to upper GI bleed.
