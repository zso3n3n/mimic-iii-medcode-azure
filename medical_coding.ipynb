Brief Hospital Course:  yo male w/ progressive multiple sclerosis was admitted for AMS and seizure after having a s GTC at the OSH that responded to mg Ativan.  He had a negative head CT but was found to have a Na level of .  He has been hyponatremic in the past and this has often caused changes in his mental status.  In the ED, he was treated with L NS for concern of hypovolemic hyponatremia.  At that time, his urine osm was  and serum osm was . He also had a CXR and there was prelim concern for pneumonia which can cause an ADH like effect (the final read was neagtive).  Neurology was consulted for his AMS and seizure and they felt that his hyponatremia was likely related to recent initiation of carbamezapine for sensory illusions. Carbamezapine has a known ADH like effect and can cause hyponatremia.  Following discontinuation of carbamezapine along with fluid restriction, his Na increased.  After several days, the pt appeared slightly dehydrated so his fluid restriction was lifted. By time of discharge, his serum Na was . . In the past, his seizures have been instigated by an underlying infection. However, upon admission he was afebrile and did not have a leukocystosis.  The most likely source was either pneumonia or a UTI.  He has a suprapubic catheter   neurogenic bladder and on the day prior to admission, he had a urine sample that grew pseudomonas, a bacteria he has had in the past.  He has also had several pneumonias in the past, most likely   frequent aspirations and his first CXR was concerning for lung infiltrate.  He was treated with one dose of vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia.  Ultimately, repeat CXR and a CTA were both negative for pneumonia. . Because of his pseudomonal bacteriuria, he was started on ciprofloxacin. A urine culture drawn prior to abx inititian also grew pseudomonas.  Because he was afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis and there was thought that it may actually have been colonization as opposed to infection.  However, he was treated with a full course of cipro for a complicated UTI.  His catheter was changed and all other cultures remained negative.  . On admission, the pt was afebrile and hypertensive to  . However, shortly after arriving on the floor, he had an episode of hypotension down to the s systolic.  During this time he was mentating well, he did not have any complaints, denied chest pain, headache, and visual changes.  IVFs were given, however the hypotension did not initially respond, however came up eventually prior to getting to the ICU.  This labile blood pressure was most likely secondary to the patients autonomic dysfunction secondary to his SPMS. Other considerations were infection or possible sepsis, however the patient was continued to be afebrile. Blood and urine cultures were negative. He was monitored in the ICU for  hours with stable swings in BP which were asymptomatic and consistent with autonomic dysfunction. Changed clonidine dosing from .mg Hospital  to .mg TID. Maintained other blood pressure medications at home doses. . The next day, he was transferred out of the MICU and returned to the floor.  Shortly after arrival, he developed a fever.  More blood and urine cultures were sent and all were negative. Pneumonia had been ruled out and his UTI was being treated with a medication that was appropriate per sensitivities.  He had a CTA which was negative for PE.  However, he was started on meropenem and was treated for  days.  He was still slightly febrile but his meropenem was discontinued for concern of drug fever.  He defervesced without any further treatment. . However, his mental status continued to fluctuate despite being afebrile, no obvious source of infection, and he was eunatremic.  He was occasionally aggressive and would say that he was being murdered or kidnapped.  Neurology was reconsulted but did not feel that his symptoms were related to the keppra and they did not think he was having subclinical seizures.  He continued to have repetitive shaking moves of his head but he was conscious and able to speak during these episodes. Also, despite the Keppra, he continued to have sensory illusions, mostly centered around the feeling of having a bowel movement (when he actually was not). . During the work up for a source of infection and source of AMS, he had a CTA which revealed a liver lesion.  He had an ultrasound and a multiphase liver CT to further describe the lesion because he cannot have an MRI   an implanted baclofen pump.   Mr Known lastname  and his family decided to not biopsy the lesion at this time but it was not ruled out completely for malignancy, although unlikely.  During this work up he also had KUB that was concerning for ileus but he continued to have BMs so he was kept on a regular diet. . Prior to discharge, his mental status had not completely returned to baseline but he was alert and oriented x  and was no longer aggressive towards staff.  No definite etiology was elucidated and it was hypothesized that this could be a result of the progression of his established disease.

He was initially feeling well after discharge  / and began exercising and losing weight.  However, this past week dyspnea increased and exertional capacity decreased.  He called his cardiologist who thought he might be overdiuresed, therefore his lasix and spironolactone were reduced to half prior doses. Dyspnea worsened despite this change.  Then on the day of admission he had  bowel movements, the second of which was dark black.  The bowel movement was preceeded by crampy abdominal pain.  He attempted to walk from the bathroom to the kitchen but because acutely dyspneic.  He sat down and then developed chest pain, took a nitro with relief.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: ================= # Chest Pain: Demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed. He has known coronary vascular disease with refractory angina that is not amenable to intervention per cardiology team. No evidence of consolidation or PTX on CXR to suggest pulmonary cause. Patient was transfused a total of  units pRBCs; hematocrit initially stabilized and when heparin gtt and coumadin were re started, hematocrit dropped again and chest pain returned without EKG changes. He was continued on aspirin, plavix, and ranolazine. Imdur was started at a lower dose than home dose given concern for hypotension in setting of bleeding, but BP remained stable so imdur was titrated up to his home dose. He then had return of chest pain, with dynamic ST changes in V V and I/avL, consistent with known non intervenable areas of disease.  His imdur was increased to mg and metoprolol was increased to tartrate mg PO BID without further episodes of chest pain.  # UGIB/H.Pylori + Nodular Gastritis: On EGD, patient had evidence of nodular gastritis with superficial erosions. H.pylori returned positive and patient began triple therapy with amoxicillin (not candidate for clarithromycin given interaction with ranolazine), metronidazole and pantoprazole.  Coumadin was held and INR was reversed with vitamin K.  Patient had ongoing hematocrit drop without obvious bleeding once heparin drip was restarted, so both coumadin and heparin were stopped.  Patient will complete  weeks of triple therapy, then continue Hospital  pantoprazole.  He does not require GI follow up or test of cure. He also underwent colonoscopy which did not reveal an additional or alternative source of his bleeding. If he continues to bleed, the next step would be a capsule endoscopy. He will have a Hospital  check prior to his PCP appointment to assess his hematocrit.  # Acute blood loss anemia: Source suspected to be gastritis as above. Coumadin was held on admission to the ICU and reversed with vitamin K and FFP.  He was transfused a total of  units during admission; initially  units in the ICU as he had an inappropriate response to blood, then again on the floor as with initiation of coumadin and bridge with heparin drip, patients hematocrit drifted down.  Haptoglobin and LDH were normal, and indirect bilirubin was only slightly elevated (and was post transfusion) so low suspicion for hemolysis.  With discontinuation of heparin drip and coumadin, hematocrit stabilized and patient did not require transfusion for > hours prior to discharge.  # Constipation: Significantly constipated during admission. Required  days of prep prior to his colonoscopy.  Patient discharged on senna/colace/miralax to prevent further constipation.  # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  On admission, patient had mild pulmonary edema secondary to decreased lasix and spironolactone dose over past week prior to admission. Patient was diuresed in the ICU, and was euvolemic on transfer to the floor. He was continued on home lasix mg daily, with extra doses with transfusions. He had a few episodes of orthostatic hypotension prompting decrease of his lasix dose to mg PO daily. Patient was euvolemic at the time of discharge, and weight was stable at  kg.  # Hyperkalemia: . on admission likely secondary to ARF, spironolactone, and lisinopril.  ECG improved to narrow complex once potassium normalized. Potassium remained stable for remainder of admission.

You were admitted to Hospital  for evaluation and treatment of chest pain, shortness of breath, and GI bleeding. You were found to have a low blood count likely due to a slow bleed in your GI tract related to all of your blood thinners and gastritis with erosions from H. pylori (a bacteria that pre disposes to gastritis and ulcers).  You were started on a medication to protect your GI tract, treatment for your infection, and you were given blood transfusions to improve your blood counts. You underwent an upper endoscopy which showed the inflammation of the stomach and erosions and a colonoscopy which was without source of bleeding.  You also had an elevation in your potassium level, so your spironolactone was discontinued.  We attempted re starting anticoagulation but you began to bleed again. As a result, your coumadin is being held until resolution of your gastritis. We suggesting waiting a month or so until resuming coumadin and would like to re assure you that you are recieving protection against stroke from your afib from your aspirin and plavix.  The following changes were made to your medication regimen:   START Metronidazole three times day through Monday    to treat the infection in your stomach   START Amoxicillin twice a day through Monday    to treat the infection in your stomach   INCREASE pantoprazole to twice a day to protect your stomach lining   INCREASE Imdur to mg by mouth daily   CHANGE to Metoprolol Tartrate mg by mouth twice daily   DECREASE Lisinopril to mg daily   DECREASE Lasix to mg daily   DECREASE Insulin / to  units twice daily   STOP Spironolactone   STOP Coumadin  > you will have to discuss with your primary care doctor restarting this medication about a month from now once your gastritis has healed   START Senna and Colace twice a day as needed for constipation   START Miralax once daily as needed for constipation  Please follow up as suggested below.

He remained on pressors which were weaned slightly overnight. He received a blood transfusion for a hematocrit of . which increased to . and was weaned off pressors.  Copious secretions were noted from his ET tube. Intraoperative cultures from the OSH were obtained. They were peritoneal cultures and were polymicrobial. He was extubated and remained hemodynamically stable so was transferred to the floor on   .  At the time of transfer to the floor the pt was NPO with IV fluids and NG tube to suction. He was on IV zosyn for empiric coverage and also had a foley catheter in place for urine output monitoring. On   his NG tube output remained low so it was removed along with the foley catheter as he was making good amounts of urine.

Also of note, the liver was noted to be quite yellowed in appearance suspicious of acute fatty liver and a biopsy was sent during the abdominal closure procedure (please see operative note for details). Postoperatively, his vent was weaned with continued diuresis. He was extubated on    and transferred back to the floor hemodynamically stable.  On   he was noted to have gas and a small amout of stool from his ostomy so his diet was advanced as tolerated. His foley catheter which had been placed upon return to the operating room was again removed and he voided without difficulty. His vital signs were routinely monitored and he remained afebrile and hemodynamically. His lung sounds were noted to have crackles and his chest x ray appreared wet and he was diuresed with lasix as needed. His white blood cell count  began trending downward to  from .

She was readmitted    after she was found to have a multifocal pneumonia and was treated with Levo/Flagyl and Vanco. Cultures were positive for MRSA. Levo and Flagyl were continued for suspected aspiration PNA. The pt recovered quickly over since admission and she is now back on her home O requirement. She was getting bridged for her anticoagulation with Lovenox starting   in preparation for discharge.  However, she developed severe abdominal pain and a palpable mass in her L abdomen.

She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin.  She completed a  day course of levofloxacin.  MRSA was found to grow in her sputum so she was continued on a  day course of vancomycin. She originally presented with elevated WBC count and left shift which quickly resolved with the initiation of antibiotics.  Her productive cough improved as well and she remained on her baseline home O of L.  Approximately  days after completion of her  day course of Vancomycin, the patient developed worsening cough, SOB, and upper respiratory symptoms. A repeat CXR showed evidence of a new consolidation in the RLL. The patient was started back on Levofloxacin/Flagyl.  Vancomycin was added to her regimen when blood cultures showed / bottles with GPC in clusters and chains.  Additionally, her sputum culture grew out GNRs.  Levofloxacin was discontinued and Meropenem was started for concern for Pseudomonas given the patients long hospital course.  Her O sat remained stable  % on L nasal cannula (which is her baseline).  She was given mucomyst inhaled nebulizers to assist in breaking up thick sputum.  Her GNRs in the sputum grew out E. coli.  Because of the sensitivity profile of the E. coli and the patients allergy to penicillin and cephalosporins, the patient was continued on Meropenem.  Her GPCs were found to grow out Coag negative Staph.  Surveillance cultures had no further growth and the coag negative staph was thought to likely be a contaminant.  Her Vancomycin was discontinued.  She will continue a  day course of Meropenem and she was discharged with a PICC to complete this course. . # Pulmonary embolism/DVTs: She has had multiple PEs and has had one even since the placement of a TrapEase IVC filter. CT during recent previous hospitalization revealed appropriate location of filter and CTA on this admission showed improvement of clot. Admission labwork revealed an INR of ..  Coumadin was thus held and reversed with FFP and vitamin K given her history of GIB on anticoagulation.  In the interim, therapeutic lovenox injections were initiated, but within days of starting, she developed a large abdominal wall hematoma near to lovenox injection site.  Once her hematocrit stabilized, she was started on a heparin gtt with coumadin overlap.  While Last Name (NamePattern)  her Coumadin with an INR ., she was found to have a large Hct drop and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new rectus hematoma.  She was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. It was decided after her second hematoma while on anticoagulation, the risks of anticoagulation outweigh the benefits at this time and she was not anticoagulated.  In terms of her hypercoagulable workup, it has been negative thus far for hyperhomocysteinemia, Factor V Leiden and antiphospholipid antibody. Malignancy workup included a colonoscopy and EGD as well as CEA, all of which were within normal limits. SPEP revealed hypogammaglobulinemia, but was otherwise unremarkable. During her hospital course, she also began to complain of worsening lower extremity pain.  LENIs were obtained which showed evidence of extensive, completely occlusive, bilateral deep venous thrombi extending from the common femoral veins to the popliteal veins.  Radiology felt that these clots were most likely acute to subacute in nature.  In this setting, hematology/oncology saw the patient again to consider the risks vs benefits of anticoagulation.  Antithrombin III, prothrombin mutation, Lupus anticoagulation and Location (un)  Venom Viper were sent to reevaluate the reason for her hypercoagulability.  The hematology/oncology team still felt that the risks of coagulation outweigh the potential benefits given that the patient has had multiple bleeding episodes in the setting of anticoagulation.  # Abdominal wall hematoma: As mentioned above, she developed a large left sided abdominal wall hematoma from a Lovenox injection site that caused a significant hct drop (originally .  >.).  Despite the drop, she remained hemodynamically stable (has sinus tachycardia at baseline prior to bleed). She received  units prbcs,  units FFP. Her hematocrit then stabilized and once stable, she was restarted on heparin gtt. Coumadin was re initiated and heparin gtt was continued while awaiting her INR to become therapeutic.  While Location (un)  her Coumadin with an INR ., she was found to have another Hct drop (. > .) and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new right sided rectus hematoma.  She was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.  She was given  unit FFP and  units PRBCs between Date range ()  until her hematocrit became stable and she bumped appropriately to transfusion.  It was decided after her second hematoma while on anticoagulation, the risks of anticoagulation outweigh the benefits at this time and she was not anticoagulated.  She has complained of   abdominal pain with movement and has maintained stable hematocrits.  Her pain is most likely   to the large rectus hematoma that will resolve over time.  Her Hct remained stable after her anticoagulation was discontinued.  # Thoracic mass:  CT chest and abdomen revealed a stable thoracic mass (stable x years) and thought potentially consistent with neural cyst.  It was not further evaluated by MRI given its long term stability and also she has metal hardware in place s/p elbow surgery and facial plates.  It should be followed up with imaging to ensure it remains unchanged in the future.  # ? Zoster:  Patient reports having a history of herpes on her right buttock.  During her stay, she developed a tingling, itchiness and multiple small erythematous skin lesions on her right buttock over the S, S dermatomal distribution.  There were no vesicles appreciated.  She was treated with acyclovir.  # Candidal vaginitis:  Treated with fluconazole x  with resolution of symptoms.  # H/o GI bleeding during recent admission: Recent colonoscopy showed diverticulosis with no active signs of bleeding.  She had no blood in her stools during this admission even while anticoagulated.  Her stools were guiac ed multiple times and were found to be guiac negative.  # Constipation: She is constipated at baseline and requires daily scheduled bowel regimen to maintian regularity.  # Hyperlipidemia: Continued on lipitor.  # Depression/SAD: Continued on Prozac, risperdone, wellbutrin, and klonopin.  # Ulcerative Colitis: Remains in remission.  She was continued on mesalamine.  # Orthostatic hypotension: She remained asymptomatic even while ambulating with physical therapy.  She was continued on midodrine.  Medications on Admission: .

Hospital course was notable for admission to the ICU where she was found to have lung and renal abscesses, septic shock requiring vasopressor support, DVT and PE, and difficult to control atrial fibrillation. She was also noted to have a large esophageal mass suggestive of esophageal cancer with compression of the left main stem bronchus causing intermittent lung collapse and esophageal compression with dysphagia/aspiration. Patient had a long ICU course and transferred from the floor to the ICU multiple times. Ultimately, given the patients multiple significant and severe medical problems, age, and progressively declining course despite maximal medical care, a discussion was held with the family and the decision was to transition the patients care to comfort centered care and the patient passed away    at :AM.  #Septic shock/Lung and renal abscesses: Patient presented in septic shock from pneumonia with empyema and was found to have lung and renal abscesses. She required multiple pressors and intubation. Her lactate peaked at . CT demonstrated multiple fluid collections as well as an esophageal mass (see below) that was compressing the L mainstem bronchus that was believed to be predisposing to her polymicrobial infection. Interventional pulmonology placed two chest tubes to drain the fluid collections. Gram stain showed GPCs, GNRs and gram positive rods. Cultures only grew strep angionosis. She was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics but was weaned down to vancomycin and flagyl per ID recommendations for a planned course of four weeks from the date of her last chest tube placement (day one  ). She was weaned off pressors and succesfully extubated. She was treated with vanc/flagyl until she was made CMO on   .  #DVT/PE: Patient was found to have DVT on lower extremity ultrasound. CTA showed small subsegmental RLL PE. Patient was placed on heparin gtt. After her goals of care discussion anticoagulation was held on   .  #Esophageal Mass, likely esophageal cancer, with bronchial and esophageal obstruction: CT showed large  mid esophageal soft tissue mass with now complete opacification of the left main bronchus either by invasion, hemorrhage, and/or secretions. There was persistent post obstructive left lower lobe consolidation and bronchial secretions and patient did suffer collapse of her left lung. It was believed that this mass was the etiology of her polymicrobial septic shock, as well as persistent pleural effusions and left sided atelectatsis. Secondary to the obstruction of the esophagus and risks for aspiratoin, the patient was made NPO. She did transiently receive TPN, but this was discontinued when care was transitioned to comfort centered care.  #Atrial fibrillation: Unclear if patient has history of afib, but this was likely exacerbated or caused by infection/sepsis. There may also have been contribution of irritation by esophageal mass. After hypotension resolved patient was managed on the medical floor with IV betablockers but required transfer back to the ICU for rapid atrial fibrillation and low blood pressures in the s. She was subsequently rate controlled with IV amiodarone drip in the ICU and transferred back to the medical floor. After family discussion regarding overall goals of care amiodarone was eventually discontinued.  # Acute Renal failure: Creatinine . with unclear baseline. Her creatinine later increased to a peak of . which was believed to be ATN from septic shock. Her creatinine trended back down to .. On the floor  her creatinine remained at baseline.  # Anemia: She required  UPRBC in setting of elevated lactate and septic shock. Hct stabilzed in mid s.  #Goals of care discussion: Throughout hospitalization multiple family meetings/updates were held with multiple providers/teams. Palliative care was involved as were the social work and case management teams. With the patients age of > years and multiple medical problems that continued to progress despite medical care (including IV amiodarone drip, TPN, antibiotics, and IV anticoagulation), the family decided to focus on comfort centered care on   .

IMAGING:   CT C/A/P: TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from the chest, abdomen and pelvis with the administration of IV contrast. Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed. CT OF THE CHEST: Right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis. Left base opacification likely represents collapsed left lower lobe which appears airless and filled with higher density material, possibly blood. The patient has a nasogastric tube which passes into the stomach. ETT tube appears approximately .cm above the carina. The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable. CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: The intra Month/Day ()  vasculature and intra Month/Day ()  solid organs are incompletely evaluated in the absence of IV contrast. Within this limitation, the liver, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands appear unremarkable. Note is made of splenomegaly. Both kidneys show no evidence of large masses. A non obstructive  mm stone is noted within the lower pole of the left kidney (B, ). Small stones are noted within the right kidney. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. Surgical sutures are noted in the RLQ, otherwise, intra Month/Day ()  loops of large and small bowel appear unremarkable. There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen. Retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes do not meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement. The structures within the pelvis are incompletely evaluated due to the presence of streak artifact due to bilateral total hip replacements. Within this limitation, the patient is status post a Foley catheter. A right femoral vein catheter is identified. A possible rectal catheter is noted. Bilateral hip prosthesis are noted; the right femoral component appears well seated within the acetabular component; however, the left femoral component is not well seated within the left acetabular component. Decrease in vertebral body height of L vertebral body is noted with possible retropulsion of fragment into the spinal canal and indentation of the thecal sac. This is of indeterminate chronicity, but likely represents more chronic process with the presence of what looks like kyphoplasty material within L vertebral body. Intra Month/Day ()  vasculature is not well evaluated in the absence of contrast technique.  IMPRESSION: . Right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis. Left base opacification likely represents collapsed left lower lobe which appears airless and filled with higher density material, possibly blood.  . Left lower pole renal calculus. . Incomplete evaluation of the pelvis due to streak artifact. . Left total hip arthroplasty prosthesis shows femoral component is not well seated within the acetabular component. . Loss of vertebral body height of L vertebral body with possible retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal; this is of indeterminate chronicity, however, appears to be chronic due to presence of what appears to be kyphoplastic material. .   CT HEAD:TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the head without the administration of IV contrast. Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed. There is no evidence of acute fracture or traumatic dislocation. Bilateral mastoid air cells are clear. Minimal mucosal thickening is noted within bilateral maxillary sinuses. There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, discrete masses, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. Doctor Last Name  white matter differentiation is preserved with no evidence of large acute major vascular territory infarction. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathological process. ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is marked anterior rotation of the odontoid process relative to a thickened appearance of the body of C. The finding likely represents a fracture/subluxation deformity. There is resultant prominent central canal narrowing at this level. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this locale. It is possible that the finding represents a prior, healed fracture, but clearly this question must be resolved, through either obtaining prior records/imaging studies immediately, and/or subsequent spinal CT imaging. In the meantime, the patients neck needs to be stabilized. .   CT CSPINE: COMPARISON: CT head from    and portable C spine radiograph from   .  TECHNIQUE: Helical . mm axial MDCT sections were obtained from the skull base through the level of T. Sagittal and coronal reformations were obtained and reviewed.  FINDINGS: There is a large mass of new bone formation causing fusion of the C and C vertebral bodies anteriorly, with anterior subluxation of C with respect to C(b:). This results in severe encroachment on the spinal canal by the posterior arch of C. The degree of subluxation is unchanged from the prior study. There is no fracture identified. There is extensive fusion of every facet joint from C to T, comprising all the levels imaged. There is also interbody fusion involving every cervical level. There has been surgical anterior fusion at C . There is extensive fusion of the lamina and interlaminar ligaments throughout the visualized levels. In the portion of thoracic spine included in the study, there is fusion of costovertebral and costotransverse articulations. Comparison with a torso CT of    reveals similar ankylosis in the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints. These findings indicate a spondyloarthropathy with manifestations typical of ankylosing spondylitis. Correlation with the remainder of her medical history will be helpful.  IMPRESSION: . Anterior subluxation of C on C without evidence of fracture. The anterior arch of C is fused to the odontoid process via a thick layer of bone that contributes to the subluxation. This produces severe encroachment on the spinal canal by the posterior arch of C. . There are extensive fusions of multiple spinal joints most suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis. . No evidence of acute fracture. .   PELVIS PLAIN FILM: Comparison is made to selected images from an Month/Day ()  pelvic CT scan dated   .  SINGLE PORTABLE AP PELVIC FILM WAS OBTAINED    AT : Bilateral total hip replacements are seen. The femoral and acetabular components appear to be well approximated on this single AP view. The distal end of both femoral components is not included on the image. There is no evidence of loosening of the femoral components. Hypertrophic bone is seen lateral to the right femoral component. A right femoral catheter is in place. No displaced fracture of the pelvis is appreciated. Surgical chain sutures are seen in the right lower quadrant, suggesting prior colonic surgery. A Foley catheter is in place. Several radiopaque densities are seen lateral to the left femoral component within the soft tissues which may be sutural in etiology. Clinical correlation is advised.  IMPRESSION: Bilateral total hip replacements with both appearing to be normally positioned on this single portable view. No evidence of displaced fracture of the pelvis.  Left upper extremity ultrasound   : IMPRESSION: Non occlusive thrombus within one of two paired brachial veins, which extends to the axillary vein.  Portable chest x ray   : IMPRESSION: Persistent sizable parenchymal infiltrate in left lower lobe area. No new abnormalities in this portable chest examination.   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. Known lastname  is a  year old female with a history of suicide attempts and subsequent liver disease, multiple infections including ESBL Klebsiella and osteomyelitis who takes chronic steroids for ankylosis spondylitis presented from an outside hospital intubated and requiring pressors. . ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUE: # Acute metabolic acidosis without respiratory compensation: Her pH upon admission to ICU was . with a bicarb of , later worsened to . with bicarb of .  The possible etiologies of her primary metabolic acidosis include intoxication versus sepsis.  The active Doctor Last Name /s seem to have suppressed her respiratory drive (additional respiratory acidosis) as well as causing a primary metabolic acidosis.  She was treated with IV fluids with bicarbonate as well as hyperventilation on mechanical ventilation in order to improve the acidosis and elevated pCO.  Also, the toxicology and psychiatry services were consulted to assist with identifying the cause of her ingestion.  Finally, she was started empirically on piperacillin/tazobactam with vancomycin to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia. . # Respiratory failure: She was intubated upon arrival but able to be ventilated well including a recruitment procedure to open her atelectatic lung seen on CT.  She was extubated easily and did well on room air afterwards.  As discussed above, it was thought that she aspirated while she was impaired from an unknown ingestion.  Her CT chest was consistent with some small bilateral pneumonia.  Following stabilization and extubation, induced sputum results returned positive for MRSA.  She completed a  day course of vancomycin.  She remained afebrile throughout remainder of course on the medical floor.  PICC was discontinued prior to Doctor Last Name . . # Hypotension:  Pt was hypotensive on admission to ICU.  Her hypotension is of unclear etiology.  It seems possible that she had sepsis  likely from pneumonia.  Also, she may have been down long enough to miss her home florinef dose, resulting in hypotension.  Lastly, the ingestion itself could have caused hypotension.  She was treated with IV fluids, antibiotics as above, and stress doses of steroids.  Blood pressures were stable during floor course.  She was started on captopril when she became hypertensive with subsequent good control. . # Psychologic issues:  We suspect that she had a purposeful ingestion with suicidal attempt.  Blood tox was positive for benzos and tricyclics.  Urine tox was positive for benzos, cocaine, and opiates.  However, the patient did not admit suicide ideation; she intermittently reported that she may have accidentally ingested more medications than intended. Psychiatry was consulted and they recommended a : sitter.  She was placed on section .  She was followed by psychiatry and often refused full interviewing.  She did not admit to suicide ideation but given her prior suicide attempts and depression with inability to care for herself, she was transferred to psych facility for further care.  All of her psychiatric medications were held during hospital stay.  She was started on low dose seroquel on the floor prior to transfer to help with sleep. . # Rhabdomyolysis:  Her admission Creatinine was . (baseline is < .) with phosphate > and CK of Numeric Identifier .  She was treated with IV fluids and alkalinization of the urine (with bicarb).  Her creatinine improved to baseline and her CK trended down quickly. . # Transaminitis:  She has a history of liver disease secondary to toxic ingestions.  Her AST/ALT ratio suggests EtOH damage. APAP <  at OSH.  LFTs normalized by time of Numeric Identifier . . # Odontoid fracture and Hip dislocation:  Patient originally arrived in the ED with dislocated hip which was reduced. However, while intubated she awoke and again dislocated her hip while agitated.  It has been put in a brace after a second reduction.  Her CT head showed an old odontoid fracture, confirmed with CT neck.  She was kept immobilized until cleared by ortho spine team.  For her hip, ortho recommended that she continue with posterior hip precautions.  She is weight bearing as tolerated. . # Left upper extremity DVT:  Patient failed bilateral internal jugular central lines in the outside hospital and then failed a left subclavian and left IR guided PICC here.  Imaging looks like there is some type of central obstruction, L brachiocephalic vein no flow past it on venogram.  She was eventually able to get a midline at level of axillary. Ultrasound showed left upper extremity DVT.  She was initially started on heparin gtt with coumadin.  She was then transitioned to lovenox with coumadin.  INR was therapeutic for several days between  and  by time of Numeric Identifier  on mg of warfarin daily. Pt currently is at risk of falling (due to her ankylosing spondylitis and hip dislocations) and syncope from substance abuse.  However, given that she will be transferred to an extended care facility, it was felt that benefits of anticoagulation would outweigh the risks at this time. When ready for Numeric Identifier , there should be another discussion of anticoagulation.   After rehabilitation from both physical and mental viewpoint, risks/benefits of anticoagulation should be re assessed.  In the meantime, fall precautions should be continued at psych facility . # Diarrhea: Pt had several loose BMs daily.  C.diff was negative x .  Given amount of diarrhea, she was empirically started on oral flagyl mg TID.  C.diff PCR was sent in the meantime. PCR returned negative and flagyl was discontinued.  She was started on immodium with symptomatic relief . # Tinea corporis: Pt had several macular patches on lower back and right leg with central clearing.  This was consistent with tinea corporis.  She was treated with clotrimazole cream Hospital . . # Pain control: Pt with longstanding history of narcotic use. She frequently demanded IV dilaudid for nonspecific complaints, including Hospital  pain.  Also has ankylosing spondylitis, left hip dislocation, and left hand IV infiltration of levophed from OSH that can contribute to pain. Pain consult obtained who recommended maintaining current narcotic regimen of oral dilaudid qh.  She was also given lidoderm patch and ibuprofen for pain relief. Oral dilaudid was transitioned to oral oxycodone prior to Hospital  which patient reported was more satisfactory. . # Communication: Name (NI)  Name (NI)  (HCP)   (Telephone/Fax () ; First Name (NamePattern)  Name (NI)  (son)   Telephone/Fax ()    Medications on Admission: clonazepam  mg Hospital , . mg daily tizanidine  mg qhs ranitidine  mg Hospital  trazodone  mg daily gabapentin  mg tid fentanyl patch  mcg/hr every  hours ketoconazole tramadol  mg qid macrobid  mg Hospital   Hospital  Medications: . captopril . mg Tablet Sig: .

Month/Day/Year  Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Hospital    Hospital  Diagnosis: Overdose Depression/ Hx of suicide attempt Pneumonia Left upper extremity DVT Hypertension Tinea corporis   Hospital  Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory   requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).   Hospital  Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital.  You were admitted after being found in your home unconscious.  You were intubated and in the ICU.  You likely had an ingestion that caused you to lose consciousness.  You will be transferred to a psychiatric facility where you will continue to receive mental health care.  During your hospital stay, you were treated for pneumonia with an IV antibiotic; you finished this course.  You were also started on a blood thinner called coumadin for a blood clot found in your left arm.  You will need to have levels of this medication in your blood monitored   times weekly. After psychiatric and physical rehabilitation, the risks and benefits of blood thinners should be revisited so that we can determine how long you should stay on this medication.  Please see attached sheet for your new medications.  Followup Instructions: You will be seen by psychiatrists and physicians at your facility.    Completed by:\n",
