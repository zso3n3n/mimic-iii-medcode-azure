Within limitations , vascular injuries identified . Specifically , carotid arteries cervical branches , vertebral arteries appear patent . Although stenoses pseudoaneurysms detected , sensitivity abnormalities severely limited technical limitation discussed . Sensitivity mural dissection quite low , although dissections detected . CONCLUSION Limited study reasons described . evidence arterial injury limited examination .
