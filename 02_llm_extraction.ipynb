    "**Goal of this notebook:**  \n",
    "Use AI to extract ONLY the important components of the Mimic-III NOTEEVENT TEXT field. Removing details such as admission dates and medical dosages will reduce the token count, and simplify the text _while_ keeping relevant context and the original sentences that would be lost if we were to use a parser such as [Azure Text Analytics for Health](./01_az_text_analytics.ipynb) or the [mednlp](https://github.com/plandes/mednlp) python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted data will be used to...  \n",
    "- Simplify the note text before attempting to code. This will improve calssification results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**  \n",
    "- Setup Azure Open AI Resource with GPT-4o deployment, ensure [.env](./.env.sample) file is populated up to date"
