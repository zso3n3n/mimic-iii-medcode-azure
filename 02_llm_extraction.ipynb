At this point, the\\nCardiothoracic Surgery service was consulted, and they felt\\nthat an original radiology drainage of loculated fluid\\ncollection in her lung would be the most diagnostic benefit\\nfor the patient.\\n\\nOvernight from [**3-18**] to [**3-19**], it was decided to reverse the\\npatient's Coumadin, units of fresh-frozen plasma were given,\\nand the patient's Heparin was held.  The same night the\\npatient complained of increasing hip pain and late that night\\napproximately 3 am to 6 am, the patient began to complain of\\nsome numbness and weakness in her foot.  In the morning, she\\nwas evaluated by the team on am rounds.  Her right foot was\\nfound to be significantly weak in the AT muscles, the calf\\nmuscles.  She was unable to activate her [**Last Name (un) **].  She has some\\neversion and inversion function.  Sensation was diminished in\\na L5-S1 distribution.  These findings were discussed with Dr.\\n[**First Name (STitle) **] of the Orthopedic Service, who came to evaluate the\\npatient, which for a MRI of the L spine was to be performed.\\nThis scan was performed and was negative except for the\\npelvic hematoma which was again seen.\\n\\nAt this point, the patient's aspirin was held.  Hematocrit\\nwas drawn at that time which demonstrated a drop from 31 to\\napproximately 21.  The patient was transfused 2 units of\\nblood without a rise in her hematocrit.  At this point, Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], the covering Trauma attending was consulted, who\\nwished to give the patient DDAVP in order to partially\\nmitigate the effect of the aspirin and Plavix, which the\\npatient had been maintained on for her carotid dissection.\\nThis was given, and the patient continued to be transfused\\nwith fresh-frozen plasma and red blood cells.  Her INR\\ndropped to a value of 1.1.  Her PTT normalized, and her\\nhematocrit rose to a value in the high 20s to low 30s.\\n\\nIn light of this bleed and new neurologic finding, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]\\nrequested that we consult the Neurology Service.  The\\nNeurology Service was consulted and felt that the patient had\\na leg weakness and numbness in the distribution which\\nsuggested a lower motor neuron weakness with sensory loss in\\nthe L5 distribution.  There is a question of whether or not\\nthis hematoma in the pelvis was either compressing the\\nlumbosacral roots or the sciatic nerve.\\n\\nThe results of this neurologic evaluation was discussed with\\nboth Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  At that time, a CT scan was\\nperformed which demonstrated two-fold increase in the size of\\nthe gluteal hematoma without change in the size of the pelvic\\nhematoma from the CT scan which had been done several days\\npreviously in evaluation of the patient's rising white count.\\nAt that time, it was decided to take the patient to the\\noperating room for evacuation of the pelvic hematoma as well\\nas angiography to rule out the presence of any pelvic vessels\\nwhich were still bleeding.\\n\\nOn [**2178-3-22**], late in the evening, the patient was taken to\\nthe operating room.  Large amount of pelvic hematoma was\\nevacuated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was\\ntransferred, intubated straight to the angiography suite\\nwhere an angiogram was negative for further bleeding.\\nPatient was transferred from angiography to the PACU, where\\nshe was subsequently extubated.  She returned from the PACU\\nto the floor in good condition.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient's anticoagulation was held for a\\nnumber of days.  On [**2178-3-26**], it was decided to restart the\\npatient on Coumadin.  Subsequent several days, the patient's\\nneurologic examination gradually improved in the right foot\\nto where she was approximately 4/5 strength in dorsiflexion\\nand 4/5 strength in plantar flexion with some activation of\\nthe [**Last Name (un) **].  Her sensory examination also changed such that she\\nhad recovered sensation in the L5 distribution, although she\\ndid have some pain most likely related to nerve root\\ncompression.\\n\\nThe following week additionally in working with Physical\\nTherapy service, the patient complained of some right knee\\npain.  On [**2178-3-28**], the patient had a right knee x-ray which\\ndemonstrated a small transverse patellar fracture.  The\\nOrthopedic service again saw the patient and decided to treat\\nthis fracture in a knee immobilizer.\\n\\nOn [**2178-3-30**] with the patient's INR at a value of 1.9, was\\nable to tolerate a regular diet, and her pain well controlled\\nwith oral pain medications, it was decided to discharge the\\npatient to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1.

They did not observe new\\nleft arm weakness although they had difficult testing him as he\\nwas not following commands at the time.  At 10:15am, team\\nobserved that patient was not speaking. He was not following any\\ncommands. Patient was not moving his left arm.  The neurology\\nstroke consult was recalled and evaluated the patient. It was\\nnoted that he was moving his left side but his eyes were\\ndeviated to the right and he had profound neglect of the left\\nside of his body.  He had a CTA and a CTP of the head and neck\\nand there was determined to be ischemia of the right hemisphere,\\nalthough not frank infarction.  He was noted also to have an\\nocculsion of the R ICA in the petrous portion. CT perfusion\\nshowed that there was increased mean transit time (indicating\\ndecreased flow) in the right ACA and MCA indicating ischemia.\\nCerebral blood volume was not decreased suggesting that there\\nwas not completed infarct in this region. CTA neck and brain\\nshowed that the right ICA was occluded from the proximal right\\nICA to the supraclinoid area. It was not clear when this\\nocclusion had occurred - if it was that day or in prior days. It\\nwas discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Neurointerventional Radiology\\nregarding whether to attempt opening the right ICA with MERCI\\ndevice and stenting. However, it was felt that the risks\\noutweighed the benefits. Attempting to open the right ICA could\\nresult in emboli to the right ACA and MCA which could worsen his\\nsituation because his right ACA and MCA vessels were open. The\\nfamily was informed that the procedure was not offered due to\\nthe high risk.\\n\\nThe patient was started on an heparin drip, and his\\nantihypertensive medications were held.  He was started on\\nfluids and transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  He was noted\\nto have guaic positive stools at the time but it was felt that\\nthis risks of stroke from stump emboli outweighed the risk of\\nthe possible GI bleed.  In the unit the patient\\'s exam improved,\\nand he was attending to both sides, and intermittently following\\ncommands.\\n\\nOn [**2122-4-22**] he was noted to have dark tarry stools and some\\nsuction from his NGT was frankly bloody.  This was accompanied\\nby a drop in HCT.  His vitals remained stable througout this\\ncourse.  The heparin drip was stopped, and he was evaluated by\\nGI consult.  He was scoped on [**4-23**] and was noted to have an\\nulcer in the GE junction and a duodenal ulcer.  The GE junction\\nulcer was noted to have a blood clot indicating a recent bleed.\\nHe was also noted to have multiple erosions that GI thought were\\ndue to NSAID use.  They recommended sulcrafate and not to give\\nanti-coagulation.  They also recommended not resuming aspirin\\nbut plavix would be acceptable in 48-72 hours.  The patient Hct\\nremained stable and he was transferred out of the unit on\\n[**2122-4-24**].\\n\\n***NEUROLOGY FLOOR***\\n\\n##NEURO:\\nGiven the need for the ACA and MCA territories to maintain flow\\nfrom collateral vessels, the patient\\'s blood pressure was\\nallowed to autoregulate up to 180 systolic.  The patient was\\nstarted on plavix on [**4-27**] for stroke prevention, and aspirin and\\ncoumadin were held per the GI consult team recommendations.  The\\npatient\\'s exam remained notable for inattention to the left,\\nminimal volitional use of his left upper extremity, and minimal\\nresponse to commands, following commands intermittently but only\\never simple commands such as open your mouth or wiggle your\\nfingers.  He also remained mute and unable to manipulate his\\ntongue for swallowing.  Given the lack of improvement in these\\nareas despite no clear infarction on his CT perfusion studies,\\non [**4-29**] he underwent a brain MRI to ascertain if there had been\\nany further infarcts.  Indeed, there were areas of\\nsubacute/acute watershed infarction in the right hemisphere.\\nThe likely explanation for worsened speech and oral manipulation\\nwas thought to be due to a combination of remapping of language\\nafter his first left hemispheric stroke and bilateral loss of\\ndeeper hemispheric tissue which controls swallowing.  Given his\\nmultiple infarcts, it was discussed with the family that the\\npatient was unlikely to be able to improve greatly due to\\nprogressive infarctions.  After multiple family meetings\\ndiscussing goals of care with the palliative care team\\nfacilitating, the family felt that it was appropriate to place a\\nPEG tube.  They understood that he might never be able to walk,\\ntalk, or live outside of a nursing facility, and they will\\ncontinue to revisit the goals of care as they assess his\\nimprovement.\\n\\n##GI Bleed: The patient\\'s hematocrit was followed closely while\\nhe was on the floor and remained stable in the 28-30 range.\\nGiven this stability, frequency was decreased to daily checks on\\n[**5-1**].  The patient\\'s sucralfate was noted to be clogging his NG\\ntube, thus the medication was discontinued after discussion with\\nGI consult on [**4-27**].  GI felt that despite his ulcer it was safe\\nto proceed with PEG placement, and they have been consulted\\nregarding this placement.  The PEG was placed on [**2122-5-5**] and tube\\nfeeds were started the next day.  His H/H has remained stable\\nwith Hct of 30 the last few days.\\n\\n##UTI: The patient completed his antibiotic course for UTI that\\nhad been started on the medicine service on [**4-28**].  A repeat UA\\nwas sent on [**5-1**] just to assess off of antibiotics given that\\nthe patient seemed slightly less interactive and was normal.\\n\\n##C dif: The patient was briefly NPO after the NG tube became\\nclogged, and during that time he was given flagyl IV as there\\nwas no evidence seen that he had initially failed flagyl,\\nhowever once the NG was replaced he was started back on oral\\nvancomycin to be completed on [**5-9**] (10 days after completing UTI\\ntherapy).\\n\\n##DEPRESSION: The patient\\'s affect seemed to become flatter and\\nhe appeared less interactive from [**Date range (1) 31775**].  This was may have\\nrelated to his new strokes, however, he was started on a trial\\nof celexa on [**5-1**] given that the decision had been made to\\ncontinue aggressive therapy.\\n\\n##GU: the patient had a foley removed.  His input and output\\nshould be watched and if urine output drops a bladder scan\\nshould be performed and consider a straight catheterization\\n\\n# PPX: d/c\\'d H2 blocker given delerium, heparin SQ, bowel\\nregimen\\n# CODE: full code\\n# CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **]: [**Name (NI) **] ([**Name (NI) 12239**], HCP) [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31776**] (cell:\\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 31777**]), PMD: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Known lastname **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 16171**] Wife: [**Name (NI) **]:\\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 31778**]\\n[**Location (un) **] Health direct line 1051 2581 [**Location (un) 453**]\\n\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n(from rehab list):\\nASA 81 mg Qday\\nPlavix 75 mg Qday\\nMetoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]\\nLisinopril 20 mg Qday\\nIron 325 mg [**Hospital1 **]\\nLasix 40 mg Qday\\nColchicine 0.06 mg Qday\\nRanitidine 150 mg Qday\\nFlomax 0.4 mg Qday\\nSenna PRN\\nFleet prn constipation\\nDulcolax 10mg suppository PRN\\nMOM PRN\\nTylenol PRN\\n.\\nALLERGIES: PCN, beta-lactams, CCB\\'s\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

Bilirubin remained elevated.  She required\\nprolonged ventilatory support.  She developed progressive\\nanuric renal failure.  Consultation with the Renal Medicine\\nService was obtained.  She was maintained on broad-spectrum\\nantibiotics and IV nutrition.  She was extremely somnolent.\\nShe developed progressive severe ARDS.  Fungal coverage was\\nadded to her drug regimen.  Intensive consultations were had\\nwith the son and with the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy.\\nUltimately, decision was made to withdrawal support due to\\nthe patient's lack of progress and wishes that had been\\nexpressed by her, prior to surgery.

Due to somnolence and poor gag reflex, he was\\nintubated and admitted to the ICU. NG lavage was performed and\\nrevealed coffee grounds. GI was consulted and he received IV\\nPPI, and one unit of pRBCs. They perfomed upper endoscopy which\\nshowed gastritis, no evidence of active bleeding, and pill\\nfragments (some of which could be collected). Per toxicology,\\nserial aspirin levels were checked with a max of 38. He was\\ngiven IVFs with bicarb, and actived charcoal on [**1-3**]. There was\\nsome concern re: serotonin syndrome but with no symptoms of this\\nand nl QT intervals on serial EKGs. He was treated for a likely\\naspiratin pneumonia with Unasyn, transitioned to Augmentin, was\\nextubated and is now satting well on room air.

A nasogastric tube courses\\nthrough the esophagus, enters into the stomach, but extends off\\nthe field of view of this image. Lung volumes are low. No focal\\nconsolidations are present. The left costophrenic angle was\\nexcluded from view of this image. The cardiac silhouette, hilar\\nand mediastinal contours appear normal. The aorta is slightly\\ntortuous.\\nIMPRESSION: ET tube in satisfactory position. Lung volumes are\\nlow without\\nevidence for focal consolidation.\\n.\\nCT head without contrast [**2108-1-3**]:  FINDINGS: There is no\\nhemorrhage, Edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular\\nterritorial infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation\\nappears well preserved. In the region of the left basal ganglia\\nis a prominent CSF space (2:11). There is moderate mucosal\\nthickening with air-fluid level within the right maxillary sinus\\nand bilateral ethmoid air cells. The frontal sinuses, sphenoid\\nsinuses, and mastoid air cells are clear. Middle ear cavity is\\nclear. The globes and orbits are intact. There are no fractures.\\nRounded hyperdensity along the posterior medial region of the\\ninferior bony orbit (2:5) on axial images is not substantiated\\non coronal reformatted images and likely represents volume\\naveraging with the orbital bone and inferior rectus.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. No acute intracranial pathology.\\n2. Moderate right maxillary and ethmoid sinus opacification.\\n.\\nChest radiography [**2108-1-4**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the\\nstudy of [**1-3**], the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been\\nremoved. The right base is now essentially clear, and there is\\nno convincing evidence of aspiration.\\n.\\nChest radiography [**2108-1-6**]:\\nIMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-3**] and 13.\\nMild relative congestion in the right lung could be due to early\\nedema in the site of previous aspiration, but does not suggest\\npneumonia. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Tiny left\\npleural effusion is seen only on the lateral view. Heart size\\nnormal. No pneumothorax.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nThis is a 68 year old male with a past medical history of\\ndepression who was admitted status post suicide attempt with\\noverdose ingestion of Seroquel, Paxil, and aspirin.  Status post\\n3 day course in the MICU.  Now doing well on the floor and as of\\n[**2108-1-7**], medically stable for transfer to psychiatric unit for\\nfurther management of acute on chronic depression.\\n.\\nSuicidal Ingestion: Mr. [**Known lastname 84199**] was admitted after ingesting a\\nlarge number of aspirin tablets, Seroquel and Paxil. This was\\nconfirmed by toxicology and EGD. NGT was placed, activated\\ncharcoal administered, and bicarb gtt was started. EKG and ABGs\\nwere followed serially. Made NPO and started on IV pantoprazole.\\nEGD revealed a large number of intact aspirin tablets in the\\nantrum of his stomach, which were removed. ASA known to cause\\nspasm of the pylorus, so gastric emptying may have been slowed.\\nErosions had appeared - a likely cause of hematemesis at\\npresetation. ASA continued to rise early in the admission with a\\npeak of 38, which fell to 11 prior to transfer to the general\\nmedicine floor. Bicarbonate was given for resulting acidosis. A\\nmarked anion gap was never present. In regards to paxil and\\nseroquel, patient was monitored closely for extrapyramidal\\nsymptoms and for serotonin syndrome but none were found.\\nMedically stable for transfer to psychiatric floor.\\n.\\nAcute Blood Loss Anemia: Secondary to gastritis from pill\\ningestion, as evidenced by EGD.  Required 1 unit PRBC\\ntransfusion but hematocrits were measured serially and have been\\nstable upon reaching the general medicine floor.  IV PPI was\\ninitially administered and was transitioned to PO.  Lisinopril\\nand nifedipine was restarted and uptitrated to home dose with\\nstable blood pressures.\\n.\\nDepression and Suicidality: Patient is status post suicide\\nattempt with overdose of seroquel, paxil, and aspirin.  Familial\\npredisposition may have played some role.  He will likely\\nbenefit more from combined therapy and medication.\\nAnti-depressive/anxiety medications were held in the context of\\nhaving received an enormous dose.  Was placed on 1:1 sitter.\\nConsulted by social work and psychiatry teams.  Will likely\\nreinitiate antidepressant treatment upon transfer to psychiatric\\nunit.  Patient is medically stable as of [**2108-1-7**] and will\\nrequire transfer to psychiatric inpatient facility for further\\nmanagement of psychiatric issues.\\n.\\nAspiration Pneumonia: Chemical lung injury suspected on basis of\\nclear aspiration of blood and stomach contents.  Due to question\\nof pneumonia on chest radiograph, was started on Unasyn and\\ntransitioned to Augmentin in the MICU.  Was found to develop low\\ngrade fevers upon reaching the general medicine floor, with\\nnegative culture data.  Due to question of drug fever (and\\ndocumented allergy to amoxicillin), patient was transitioned to\\nlevaquin.  Intermittent low grade fevers are likely secondary to\\nresolving URI.  Medically stable for transfer to psychiatry.\\n.\\nAcute Renal Failure: Peaked to high of 1.9.  [**Month (only) 116**] be\\nmultifactorial, with urine lytes nondiagnostic.  Brief period of\\nhypotension, aspirin ingestion, and elevation of CK associated\\nwith rhabdomyolysis may have all contributed to kidney damage.\\nWas given IV hydration with normalization of creatinine.\\n.\\nRhabdomyolysis: Patient found on the floor for unclear duration.\\n Likely muscle breakdown with CK rising to [**2003**].  CK values at\\nthe time of discharge were within normal limits.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n- Paroxetine 40mg QD 30 [**12-14**]\\n- Seroquel 100mg 2 QHS 60 [**12-14**]\\n- Citalopram 30mg PO daily\\n- Ativan 1mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN\\n- Lisinopril 40mg PO daily\\n- nifedipine sr 30mg PO daily\\n- asa 81mg daily\\n\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

[**2178-3-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-3-30**]\\n\\nDate of Birth:   [**2156-8-17**]     Sex:  F\\n\\nService:\\n\\nThis is a continuation of the previous discharge dictation\\nsummary.\\n\\nOn [**2178-3-18**] with the patient's white count climbing to a\\nvalue of 17.5, abdominal and pelvic CT scan was performed\\nwhich demonstrated a loculated fluid collection in the left\\nlung at the site of the previous VATS procedure as well as a\\nlarge pelvic and gluteal hematoma.  At this point, the\\nCardiothoracic Surgery service was consulted, and they felt\\nthat an original radiology drainage of loculated fluid\\ncollection in her lung would be the most diagnostic benefit\\nfor the patient.\\n\\nOvernight from [**3-18**] to [**3-19**], it was decided to reverse the\\npatient's Coumadin, units of fresh-frozen plasma were given,\\nand the patient's Heparin was held.  The same night the\\npatient complained of increasing hip pain and late that night\\napproximately 3 am to 6 am, the patient began to complain of\\nsome numbness and weakness in her foot.  In the morning, she\\nwas evaluated by the team on am rounds.  Her right foot was\\nfound to be significantly weak in the AT muscles, the calf\\nmuscles.  She was unable to activate her [**Last Name (un) **].  She has some\\neversion and inversion function.  Sensation was diminished in\\na L5-S1 distribution.  These findings were discussed with Dr.\\n[**First Name (STitle) **] of the Orthopedic Service, who came to evaluate the\\npatient, which for a MRI of the L spine was to be performed.\\nThis scan was performed and was negative except for the\\npelvic hematoma which was again seen.\\n\\nAt this point, the patient's aspirin was held.  Hematocrit\\nwas drawn at that time which demonstrated a drop from 31 to\\napproximately 21.  The patient was transfused 2 units of\\nblood without a rise in her hematocrit.  At this point, Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], the covering Trauma attending was consulted, who\\nwished to give the patient DDAVP in order to partially\\nmitigate the effect of the aspirin and Plavix, which the\\npatient had been maintained on for her carotid dissection.\\nThis was given, and the patient continued to be transfused\\nwith fresh-frozen plasma and red blood cells.  Her INR\\ndropped to a value of 1.1.  Her PTT normalized, and her\\nhematocrit rose to a value in the high 20s to low 30s.\\n\\nIn light of this bleed and new neurologic finding, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]\\nrequested that we consult the Neurology Service.  The\\nNeurology Service was consulted and felt that the patient had\\na leg weakness and numbness in the distribution which\\nsuggested a lower motor neuron weakness with sensory loss in\\nthe L5 distribution.  There is a question of whether or not\\nthis hematoma in the pelvis was either compressing the\\nlumbosacral roots or the sciatic nerve.\\n\\nThe results of this neurologic evaluation was discussed with\\nboth Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  At that time, a CT scan was\\nperformed which demonstrated two-fold increase in the size of\\nthe gluteal hematoma without change in the size of the pelvic\\nhematoma from the CT scan which had been done several days\\npreviously in evaluation of the patient's rising white count.\\nAt that time, it was decided to take the patient to the\\noperating room for evacuation of the pelvic hematoma as well\\nas angiography to rule out the presence of any pelvic vessels\\nwhich were still bleeding.\\n\\nOn [**2178-3-22**], late in the evening, the patient was taken to\\nthe operating room.  Large amount of pelvic hematoma was\\nevacuated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was\\ntransferred, intubated straight to the angiography suite\\nwhere an angiogram was negative for further bleeding.\\nPatient was transferred from angiography to the PACU, where\\nshe was subsequently extubated.  She returned from the PACU\\nto the floor in good condition.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient's anticoagulation was held for a\\nnumber of days.  On [**2178-3-26**], it was decided to restart the\\npatient on Coumadin.  Subsequent several days, the patient's\\nneurologic examination gradually improved in the right foot\\nto where she was approximately 4/5 strength in dorsiflexion\\nand 4/5 strength in plantar flexion with some activation of\\nthe [**Last Name (un) **].  Her sensory examination also changed such that she\\nhad recovered sensation in the L5 distribution, although she\\ndid have some pain most likely related to nerve root\\ncompression.\\n\\nThe following week additionally in working with Physical\\nTherapy service, the patient complained of some right knee\\npain.  On [**2178-3-28**], the patient had a right knee x-ray which\\ndemonstrated a small transverse patellar fracture.  The\\nOrthopedic service again saw the patient and decided to treat\\nthis fracture in a knee immobilizer.\\n\\nOn [**2178-3-30**] with the patient's INR at a value of 1.9, was\\nable to tolerate a regular diet, and her pain well controlled\\nwith oral pain medications, it was decided to discharge the\\npatient to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1.

They did not observe new\\nleft arm weakness although they had difficult testing him as he\\nwas not following commands at the time.  At 10:15am, team\\nobserved that patient was not speaking. He was not following any\\ncommands. Patient was not moving his left arm.  The neurology\\nstroke consult was recalled and evaluated the patient. It was\\nnoted that he was moving his left side but his eyes were\\ndeviated to the right and he had profound neglect of the left\\nside of his body.  He had a CTA and a CTP of the head and neck\\nand there was determined to be ischemia of the right hemisphere,\\nalthough not frank infarction.  He was noted also to have an\\nocculsion of the R ICA in the petrous portion. CT perfusion\\nshowed that there was increased mean transit time (indicating\\ndecreased flow) in the right ACA and MCA indicating ischemia.\\nCerebral blood volume was not decreased suggesting that there\\nwas not completed infarct in this region. CTA neck and brain\\nshowed that the right ICA was occluded from the proximal right\\nICA to the supraclinoid area. It was not clear when this\\nocclusion had occurred - if it was that day or in prior days. It\\nwas discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Neurointerventional Radiology\\nregarding whether to attempt opening the right ICA with MERCI\\ndevice and stenting. However, it was felt that the risks\\noutweighed the benefits. Attempting to open the right ICA could\\nresult in emboli to the right ACA and MCA which could worsen his\\nsituation because his right ACA and MCA vessels were open. The\\nfamily was informed that the procedure was not offered due to\\nthe high risk.\\n\\nThe patient was started on an heparin drip, and his\\nantihypertensive medications were held.  He was started on\\nfluids and transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  He was noted\\nto have guaic positive stools at the time but it was felt that\\nthis risks of stroke from stump emboli outweighed the risk of\\nthe possible GI bleed.  In the unit the patient\\'s exam improved,\\nand he was attending to both sides, and intermittently following\\ncommands.\\n\\nOn [**2122-4-22**] he was noted to have dark tarry stools and some\\nsuction from his NGT was frankly bloody.  This was accompanied\\nby a drop in HCT.  His vitals remained stable througout this\\ncourse.  The heparin drip was stopped, and he was evaluated by\\nGI consult.  He was scoped on [**4-23**] and was noted to have an\\nulcer in the GE junction and a duodenal ulcer.  The GE junction\\nulcer was noted to have a blood clot indicating a recent bleed.\\nHe was also noted to have multiple erosions that GI thought were\\ndue to NSAID use.  They recommended sulcrafate and not to give\\nanti-coagulation.  They also recommended not resuming aspirin\\nbut plavix would be acceptable in 48-72 hours.  The patient Hct\\nremained stable and he was transferred out of the unit on\\n[**2122-4-24**].\\n\\n***NEUROLOGY FLOOR***\\n\\n##NEURO:\\nGiven the need for the ACA and MCA territories to maintain flow\\nfrom collateral vessels, the patient\\'s blood pressure was\\nallowed to autoregulate up to 180 systolic.  The patient was\\nstarted on plavix on [**4-27**] for stroke prevention, and aspirin and\\ncoumadin were held per the GI consult team recommendations.  The\\npatient\\'s exam remained notable for inattention to the left,\\nminimal volitional use of his left upper extremity, and minimal\\nresponse to commands, following commands intermittently but only\\never simple commands such as open your mouth or wiggle your\\nfingers.  He also remained mute and unable to manipulate his\\ntongue for swallowing.  Given the lack of improvement in these\\nareas despite no clear infarction on his CT perfusion studies,\\non [**4-29**] he underwent a brain MRI to ascertain if there had been\\nany further infarcts.  Indeed, there were areas of\\nsubacute/acute watershed infarction in the right hemisphere.\\nThe likely explanation for worsened speech and oral manipulation\\nwas thought to be due to a combination of remapping of language\\nafter his first left hemispheric stroke and bilateral loss of\\ndeeper hemispheric tissue which controls swallowing.  Given his\\nmultiple infarcts, it was discussed with the family that the\\npatient was unlikely to be able to improve greatly due to\\nprogressive infarctions.  After multiple family meetings\\ndiscussing goals of care with the palliative care team\\nfacilitating, the family felt that it was appropriate to place a\\nPEG tube.  They understood that he might never be able to walk,\\ntalk, or live outside of a nursing facility, and they will\\ncontinue to revisit the goals of care as they assess his\\nimprovement.\\n\\n##GI Bleed: The patient\\'s hematocrit was followed closely while\\nhe was on the floor and remained stable in the 28-30 range.\\nGiven this stability, frequency was decreased to daily checks on\\n[**5-1**].  The patient\\'s sucralfate was noted to be clogging his NG\\ntube, thus the medication was discontinued after discussion with\\nGI consult on [**4-27**].  GI felt that despite his ulcer it was safe\\nto proceed with PEG placement, and they have been consulted\\nregarding this placement.  The PEG was placed on [**2122-5-5**] and tube\\nfeeds were started the next day.  His H/H has remained stable\\nwith Hct of 30 the last few days.\\n\\n##UTI: The patient completed his antibiotic course for UTI that\\nhad been started on the medicine service on [**4-28**].  A repeat UA\\nwas sent on [**5-1**] just to assess off of antibiotics given that\\nthe patient seemed slightly less interactive and was normal.\\n\\n##C dif: The patient was briefly NPO after the NG tube became\\nclogged, and during that time he was given flagyl IV as there\\nwas no evidence seen that he had initially failed flagyl,\\nhowever once the NG was replaced he was started back on oral\\nvancomycin to be completed on [**5-9**] (10 days after completing UTI\\ntherapy).\\n\\n##DEPRESSION: The patient\\'s affect seemed to become flatter and\\nhe appeared less interactive from [**Date range (1) 31775**].  This was may have\\nrelated to his new strokes, however, he was started on a trial\\nof celexa on [**5-1**] given that the decision had been made to\\ncontinue aggressive therapy.\\n\\n##GU: the patient had a foley removed.  His input and output\\nshould be watched and if urine output drops a bladder scan\\nshould be performed and consider a straight catheterization\\n\\n# PPX: d/c\\'d H2 blocker given delerium, heparin SQ, bowel\\nregimen\\n# CODE: full code\\n# CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **]: [**Name (NI) **] ([**Name (NI) 12239**], HCP) [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31776**] (cell:\\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 31777**]), PMD: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Known lastname **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 16171**] Wife: [**Name (NI) **]:\\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 31778**]\\n[**Location (un) **] Health direct line 1051 2581 [**Location (un) 453**]\\n\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n(from rehab list):\\nASA 81 mg Qday\\nPlavix 75 mg Qday\\nMetoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]\\nLisinopril 20 mg Qday\\nIron 325 mg [**Hospital1 **]\\nLasix 40 mg Qday\\nColchicine 0.06 mg Qday\\nRanitidine 150 mg Qday\\nFlomax 0.4 mg Qday\\nSenna PRN\\nFleet prn constipation\\nDulcolax 10mg suppository PRN\\nMOM PRN\\nTylenol PRN\\n.\\nALLERGIES: PCN, beta-lactams, CCB\\'s\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

GENERAL\\n\\nHISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old woman\\nwho presented with three days of melena and one week of\\nincreasing weakness.  Because of the complaints of chest\\npain, her son brought her to our emergency room for\\nevaluation.  She ultimately proved to have a perforated\\nduodenal ulcer.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1.  History of alcohol abuse with alcoholic cirrhosis.\\n2.  Arthritis.\\n3.  Hypertension.\\n4.  History of nephrolithiasis.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  None.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Naprosyn.\\n2.  Lopressor.\\n3.  Procardia.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a blood\\npressure of 95/40.  She was awake, but sleepy.  She appeared\\nuncomfortable.  The chest was clear.  Abdomen was obese with\\nvoluntary guarding and tenderness in the upper abdomen.\\nRectal examination showed guaiac-positive stool.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  Data revealed the following:  The admission\\nWBC was 21,000 with hematocrit of 33.5.  The bicarbonate was\\n18, BUN 39, creatinine 4.3, ALT 63, AST 74, alkaline\\nphosphatase 569, total bilirubin 4.2 with the direct\\ncomponent being 3.8.  Amylase 35, and lipase 132.  The\\nurinalysis was unremarkable.  Chest film showed free air\\nunder the right hemidiaphragm.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Contrast upper GI was obtained showing a\\nperforation of the first portion of the duodenum.  The\\npatient was aggressively fluid resuscitated.  She was taken\\nto the operating room that evening for laparotomy.  At that\\ntime she was found to have a perforation in the anterior\\nduodenal bulb.  We closed this perforation primarily and\\nplaced [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] patch.  Postoperatively, the patient did\\npoorly.  She was persistently septic in the Intensive Care\\nUnit with a very large fluid requirement.  She essentially\\ndeveloped progressive ascites and findings of end-stage liver\\ndisease.  Bilirubin remained elevated.  She required\\nprolonged ventilatory support.  She developed progressive\\nanuric renal failure.  Consultation with the Renal Medicine\\nService was obtained.  She was maintained on broad-spectrum\\nantibiotics and IV nutrition.  She was extremely somnolent.\\nShe developed progressive severe ARDS.  Fungal coverage was\\nadded to her drug regimen.  Intensive consultations were had\\nwith the son and with the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy.\\nUltimately, decision was made to withdrawal support due to\\nthe patient's lack of progress and wishes that had been\\nexpressed by her, prior to surgery.  Accordingly, the patient\\nwas made comfort-measures only and expired on [**10-1**].\\n\\nDISPOSITION:  Deceased.\\n\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:   Cirrhotic liver failure with ascites,\\nsepsis, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome,\\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation, perforated duodenal\\nulcer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 520**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 521**]\\n\\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1779**]\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:  [**2180-3-15**]  08:37\\nT:  [**2180-3-15**]  15:21\\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 13819**]\\n\"]   \n",

Findings are\\nnon-specific. Since the previous tracing of same date there is\\nprobably no significant change.\\n.\\nChest radiograph [**2108-1-2**]:  FINDINGS: The tip of the endotracheal\\ntube is 4.4 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses\\nthrough the esophagus, enters into the stomach, but extends off\\nthe field of view of this image. Lung volumes are low. No focal\\nconsolidations are present. The left costophrenic angle was\\nexcluded from view of this image. The cardiac silhouette, hilar\\nand mediastinal contours appear normal. The aorta is slightly\\ntortuous.\\nIMPRESSION: ET tube in satisfactory position. Lung volumes are\\nlow without\\nevidence for focal consolidation.\\n.\\nCT head without contrast [**2108-1-3**]:  FINDINGS: There is no\\nhemorrhage, Edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular\\nterritorial infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation\\nappears well preserved. In the region of the left basal ganglia\\nis a prominent CSF space (2:11). There is moderate mucosal\\nthickening with air-fluid level within the right maxillary sinus\\nand bilateral ethmoid air cells. The frontal sinuses, sphenoid\\nsinuses, and mastoid air cells are clear. Middle ear cavity is\\nclear. The globes and orbits are intact. There are no fractures.\\nRounded hyperdensity along the posterior medial region of the\\ninferior bony orbit (2:5) on axial images is not substantiated\\non coronal reformatted images and likely represents volume\\naveraging with the orbital bone and inferior rectus.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. No acute intracranial pathology.\\n2. Moderate right maxillary and ethmoid sinus opacification.\\n.\\nChest radiography [**2108-1-4**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the\\nstudy of [**1-3**], the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been\\nremoved. The right base is now essentially clear, and there is\\nno convincing evidence of aspiration.\\n.\\nChest radiography [**2108-1-6**]:\\nIMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-3**] and 13.\\nMild relative congestion in the right lung could be due to early\\nedema in the site of previous aspiration, but does not suggest\\npneumonia. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Tiny left\\npleural effusion is seen only on the lateral view. Heart size\\nnormal. No pneumothorax.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nThis is a 68 year old male with a past medical history of\\ndepression who was admitted status post suicide attempt with\\noverdose ingestion of Seroquel, Paxil, and aspirin.  Status post\\n3 day course in the MICU.  Now doing well on the floor and as of\\n[**2108-1-7**], medically stable for transfer to psychiatric unit for\\nfurther management of acute on chronic depression.\\n.\\nSuicidal Ingestion: Mr. [**Known lastname 84199**] was admitted after ingesting a\\nlarge number of aspirin tablets, Seroquel and Paxil. This was\\nconfirmed by toxicology and EGD. NGT was placed, activated\\ncharcoal administered, and bicarb gtt was started. EKG and ABGs\\nwere followed serially. Made NPO and started on IV pantoprazole.\\nEGD revealed a large number of intact aspirin tablets in the\\nantrum of his stomach, which were removed. ASA known to cause\\nspasm of the pylorus, so gastric emptying may have been slowed.\\nErosions had appeared - a likely cause of hematemesis at\\npresetation. ASA continued to rise early in the admission with a\\npeak of 38, which fell to 11 prior to transfer to the general\\nmedicine floor. Bicarbonate was given for resulting acidosis. A\\nmarked anion gap was never present. In regards to paxil and\\nseroquel, patient was monitored closely for extrapyramidal\\nsymptoms and for serotonin syndrome but none were found.\\nMedically stable for transfer to psychiatric floor.\\n.\\nAcute Blood Loss Anemia: Secondary to gastritis from pill\\ningestion, as evidenced by EGD.  Required 1 unit PRBC\\ntransfusion but hematocrits were measured serially and have been\\nstable upon reaching the general medicine floor.  IV PPI was\\ninitially administered and was transitioned to PO.  Lisinopril\\nand nifedipine was restarted and uptitrated to home dose with\\nstable blood pressures.\\n.\\nDepression and Suicidality: Patient is status post suicide\\nattempt with overdose of seroquel, paxil, and aspirin.  Familial\\npredisposition may have played some role.  He will likely\\nbenefit more from combined therapy and medication.\\nAnti-depressive/anxiety medications were held in the context of\\nhaving received an enormous dose.  Was placed on 1:1 sitter.\\nConsulted by social work and psychiatry teams.  Will likely\\nreinitiate antidepressant treatment upon transfer to psychiatric\\nunit.  Patient is medically stable as of [**2108-1-7**] and will\\nrequire transfer to psychiatric inpatient facility for further\\nmanagement of psychiatric issues.\\n.\\nAspiration Pneumonia: Chemical lung injury suspected on basis of\\nclear aspiration of blood and stomach contents.  Due to question\\nof pneumonia on chest radiograph, was started on Unasyn and\\ntransitioned to Augmentin in the MICU.  Was found to develop low\\ngrade fevers upon reaching the general medicine floor, with\\nnegative culture data.  Due to question of drug fever (and\\ndocumented allergy to amoxicillin), patient was transitioned to\\nlevaquin.  Intermittent low grade fevers are likely secondary to\\nresolving URI.  Medically stable for transfer to psychiatry.\\n.\\nAcute Renal Failure: Peaked to high of 1.9.  [**Month (only) 116**] be\\nmultifactorial, with urine lytes nondiagnostic.  Brief period of\\nhypotension, aspirin ingestion, and elevation of CK associated\\nwith rhabdomyolysis may have all contributed to kidney damage.\\nWas given IV hydration with normalization of creatinine.\\n.\\nRhabdomyolysis: Patient found on the floor for unclear duration.\\n Likely muscle breakdown with CK rising to [**2003**].  CK values at\\nthe time of discharge were within normal limits.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n- Paroxetine 40mg QD 30 [**12-14**]\\n- Seroquel 100mg 2 QHS 60 [**12-14**]\\n- Citalopram 30mg PO daily\\n- Ativan 1mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN\\n- Lisinopril 40mg PO daily\\n- nifedipine sr 30mg PO daily\\n- asa 81mg daily\\n\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

At this point, the\\nCardiothoracic Surgery service was consulted, and they felt\\nthat an original radiology drainage of loculated fluid\\ncollection in her lung would be the most diagnostic benefit\\nfor the patient.\\n\\nOvernight from [**3-18**] to [**3-19**], it was decided to reverse the\\npatient's Coumadin, units of fresh-frozen plasma were given,\\nand the patient's Heparin was held.  The same night the\\npatient complained of increasing hip pain and late that night\\napproximately 3 am to 6 am, the patient began to complain of\\nsome numbness and weakness in her foot.  In the morning, she\\nwas evaluated by the team on am rounds.  Her right foot was\\nfound to be significantly weak in the AT muscles, the calf\\nmuscles.  She was unable to activate her [**Last Name (un) **].  She has some\\neversion and inversion function.  Sensation was diminished in\\na L5-S1 distribution.  These findings were discussed with Dr.\\n[**First Name (STitle) **] of the Orthopedic Service, who came to evaluate the\\npatient, which for a MRI of the L spine was to be performed.\\nThis scan was performed and was negative except for the\\npelvic hematoma which was again seen.\\n\\nAt this point, the patient's aspirin was held.  Hematocrit\\nwas drawn at that time which demonstrated a drop from 31 to\\napproximately 21.  The patient was transfused 2 units of\\nblood without a rise in her hematocrit.  At this point, Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], the covering Trauma attending was consulted, who\\nwished to give the patient DDAVP in order to partially\\nmitigate the effect of the aspirin and Plavix, which the\\npatient had been maintained on for her carotid dissection.\\nThis was given, and the patient continued to be transfused\\nwith fresh-frozen plasma and red blood cells.  Her INR\\ndropped to a value of 1.1.  Her PTT normalized, and her\\nhematocrit rose to a value in the high 20s to low 30s.\\n\\nIn light of this bleed and new neurologic finding, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]\\nrequested that we consult the Neurology Service.  The\\nNeurology Service was consulted and felt that the patient had\\na leg weakness and numbness in the distribution which\\nsuggested a lower motor neuron weakness with sensory loss in\\nthe L5 distribution.  There is a question of whether or not\\nthis hematoma in the pelvis was either compressing the\\nlumbosacral roots or the sciatic nerve.\\n\\nThe results of this neurologic evaluation was discussed with\\nboth Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  At that time, a CT scan was\\nperformed which demonstrated two-fold increase in the size of\\nthe gluteal hematoma without change in the size of the pelvic\\nhematoma from the CT scan which had been done several days\\npreviously in evaluation of the patient's rising white count.\\nAt that time, it was decided to take the patient to the\\noperating room for evacuation of the pelvic hematoma as well\\nas angiography to rule out the presence of any pelvic vessels\\nwhich were still bleeding.\\n\\nOn [**2178-3-22**], late in the evening, the patient was taken to\\nthe operating room.  Large amount of pelvic hematoma was\\nevacuated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was\\ntransferred, intubated straight to the angiography suite\\nwhere an angiogram was negative for further bleeding.\\nPatient was transferred from angiography to the PACU, where\\nshe was subsequently extubated.  She returned from the PACU\\nto the floor in good condition.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient's anticoagulation was held for a\\nnumber of days.  On [**2178-3-26**], it was decided to restart the\\npatient on Coumadin.  Subsequent several days, the patient's\\nneurologic examination gradually improved in the right foot\\nto where she was approximately 4/5 strength in dorsiflexion\\nand 4/5 strength in plantar flexion with some activation of\\nthe [**Last Name (un) **].  Her sensory examination also changed such that she\\nhad recovered sensation in the L5 distribution, although she\\ndid have some pain most likely related to nerve root\\ncompression.\\n\\nThe following week additionally in working with Physical\\nTherapy service, the patient complained of some right knee\\npain.  On [**2178-3-28**], the patient had a right knee x-ray which\\ndemonstrated a small transverse patellar fracture.  The\\nOrthopedic service again saw the patient and decided to treat\\nthis fracture in a knee immobilizer.\\n\\nOn [**2178-3-30**] with the patient's INR at a value of 1.9, was\\nable to tolerate a regular diet, and her pain well controlled\\nwith oral pain medications, it was decided to discharge the\\npatient to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1.

At this point, the\\nCardiothoracic Surgery service was consulted, and they felt\\nthat an original radiology drainage of loculated fluid\\ncollection in her lung would be the most diagnostic benefit\\nfor the patient.\\n\\nOvernight from [**3-18**] to [**3-19**], it was decided to reverse the\\npatient's Coumadin, units of fresh-frozen plasma were given,\\nand the patient's Heparin was held.  The same night the\\npatient complained of increasing hip pain and late that night\\napproximately 3 am to 6 am, the patient began to complain of\\nsome numbness and weakness in her foot.  In the morning, she\\nwas evaluated by the team on am rounds.  Her right foot was\\nfound to be significantly weak in the AT muscles, the calf\\nmuscles.  She was unable to activate her [**Last Name (un) **].  She has some\\neversion and inversion function.  Sensation was diminished in\\na L5-S1 distribution.  These findings were discussed with Dr.\\n[**First Name (STitle) **] of the Orthopedic Service, who came to evaluate the\\npatient, which for a MRI of the L spine was to be performed.\\nThis scan was performed and was negative except for the\\npelvic hematoma which was again seen.\\n\\nAt this point, the patient's aspirin was held.  Hematocrit\\nwas drawn at that time which demonstrated a drop from 31 to\\napproximately 21.  The patient was transfused 2 units of\\nblood without a rise in her hematocrit.  At this point, Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], the covering Trauma attending was consulted, who\\nwished to give the patient DDAVP in order to partially\\nmitigate the effect of the aspirin and Plavix, which the\\npatient had been maintained on for her carotid dissection.\\nThis was given, and the patient continued to be transfused\\nwith fresh-frozen plasma and red blood cells.  Her INR\\ndropped to a value of 1.1.  Her PTT normalized, and her\\nhematocrit rose to a value in the high 20s to low 30s.\\n\\nIn light of this bleed and new neurologic finding, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]\\nrequested that we consult the Neurology Service.  The\\nNeurology Service was consulted and felt that the patient had\\na leg weakness and numbness in the distribution which\\nsuggested a lower motor neuron weakness with sensory loss in\\nthe L5 distribution.  There is a question of whether or not\\nthis hematoma in the pelvis was either compressing the\\nlumbosacral roots or the sciatic nerve.\\n\\nThe results of this neurologic evaluation was discussed with\\nboth Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  At that time, a CT scan was\\nperformed which demonstrated two-fold increase in the size of\\nthe gluteal hematoma without change in the size of the pelvic\\nhematoma from the CT scan which had been done several days\\npreviously in evaluation of the patient's rising white count.\\nAt that time, it was decided to take the patient to the\\noperating room for evacuation of the pelvic hematoma as well\\nas angiography to rule out the presence of any pelvic vessels\\nwhich were still bleeding.\\n\\nOn [**2178-3-22**], late in the evening, the patient was taken to\\nthe operating room.  Large amount of pelvic hematoma was\\nevacuated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was\\ntransferred, intubated straight to the angiography suite\\nwhere an angiogram was negative for further bleeding.\\nPatient was transferred from angiography to the PACU, where\\nshe was subsequently extubated.  She returned from the PACU\\nto the floor in good condition.\\n\\nPostoperatively, the patient's anticoagulation was held for a\\nnumber of days.  On [**2178-3-26**], it was decided to restart the\\npatient on Coumadin.  Subsequent several days, the patient's\\nneurologic examination gradually improved in the right foot\\nto where she was approximately 4/5 strength in dorsiflexion\\nand 4/5 strength in plantar flexion with some activation of\\nthe [**Last Name (un) **].  Her sensory examination also changed such that she\\nhad recovered sensation in the L5 distribution, although she\\ndid have some pain most likely related to nerve root\\ncompression.\\n\\nThe following week additionally in working with Physical\\nTherapy service, the patient complained of some right knee\\npain.  On [**2178-3-28**], the patient had a right knee x-ray which\\ndemonstrated a small transverse patellar fracture.  The\\nOrthopedic service again saw the patient and decided to treat\\nthis fracture in a knee immobilizer.\\n\\nOn [**2178-3-30**] with the patient's INR at a value of 1.9, was\\nable to tolerate a regular diet, and her pain well controlled\\nwith oral pain medications, it was decided to discharge the\\npatient to home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1. Motor vehicle crash.\\n2. Left thalamic versus midbrain bleed.\\n3. Anterior aspect of C2 fracture treated conservatively with\\nimmobilization in [**Location (un) 6515**]-J collar.\\n4.

Followup\\nshould be with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the Orthopedic Service,\\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 8155**] for evaluation of her acetabular fracture and\\nevaluation of her C2 fracture.  Followup should be with Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) 365**] of the Neurosurgical service, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8659**] for followup\\nof her midbrain hemorrhage as well as her carotid dissection.\\nLength of Coumadinization should be approximately 3-6 months\\nto be followed up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 365**].  The patient should followup\\nwith her primary care physician for INR management.  The\\npatient will receive laboratory draws approximately biweekly,\\nfirst to begin tomorrow and then Thursday with results phoned\\nto her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient should be maintained with a goal INR\\nof 1.5 to 2.  The patient should follow up with the Trauma\\nClinic in two weeks, phone #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 8489**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for\\nevaluation of her chest wounds.\\n\\nThe patient's activity status is to be nonweightbearing on\\nher right lower extremity x3 months.  She should be\\ntouch-down weightbearing for transfer only on the left for\\napproximately three months.  This will be reassessed by Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) 998**] of the Orthopedic Service.  The patient is to\\ncontinue on a knee immobilizer until again cleared by the\\nOrthopedic Service.  She should be a right lower extremity\\nresting splint at night given her foot weakness and the\\npatient should be in a left lower extremity splint at all\\ntimes.

They did not observe new\\nleft arm weakness although they had difficult testing him as he\\nwas not following commands at the time.  At 10:15am, team\\nobserved that patient was not speaking. He was not following any\\ncommands. Patient was not moving his left arm.  The neurology\\nstroke consult was recalled and evaluated the patient. It was\\nnoted that he was moving his left side but his eyes were\\ndeviated to the right and he had profound neglect of the left\\nside of his body.  He had a CTA and a CTP of the head and neck\\nand there was determined to be ischemia of the right hemisphere,\\nalthough not frank infarction.  He was noted also to have an\\nocculsion of the R ICA in the petrous portion. CT perfusion\\nshowed that there was increased mean transit time (indicating\\ndecreased flow) in the right ACA and MCA indicating ischemia.\\nCerebral blood volume was not decreased suggesting that there\\nwas not completed infarct in this region. CTA neck and brain\\nshowed that the right ICA was occluded from the proximal right\\nICA to the supraclinoid area. It was not clear when this\\nocclusion had occurred - if it was that day or in prior days. It\\nwas discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Neurointerventional Radiology\\nregarding whether to attempt opening the right ICA with MERCI\\ndevice and stenting. However, it was felt that the risks\\noutweighed the benefits. Attempting to open the right ICA could\\nresult in emboli to the right ACA and MCA which could worsen his\\nsituation because his right ACA and MCA vessels were open. The\\nfamily was informed that the procedure was not offered due to\\nthe high risk.\\n\\nThe patient was started on an heparin drip, and his\\nantihypertensive medications were held.  He was started on\\nfluids and transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  He was noted\\nto have guaic positive stools at the time but it was felt that\\nthis risks of stroke from stump emboli outweighed the risk of\\nthe possible GI bleed.  In the unit the patient\\'s exam improved,\\nand he was attending to both sides, and intermittently following\\ncommands.\\n\\nOn [**2122-4-22**] he was noted to have dark tarry stools and some\\nsuction from his NGT was frankly bloody.  This was accompanied\\nby a drop in HCT.  His vitals remained stable througout this\\ncourse.  The heparin drip was stopped, and he was evaluated by\\nGI consult.  He was scoped on [**4-23**] and was noted to have an\\nulcer in the GE junction and a duodenal ulcer.  The GE junction\\nulcer was noted to have a blood clot indicating a recent bleed.\\nHe was also noted to have multiple erosions that GI thought were\\ndue to NSAID use.  They recommended sulcrafate and not to give\\nanti-coagulation.  They also recommended not resuming aspirin\\nbut plavix would be acceptable in 48-72 hours.  The patient Hct\\nremained stable and he was transferred out of the unit on\\n[**2122-4-24**].\\n\\n***NEUROLOGY FLOOR***\\n\\n##NEURO:\\nGiven the need for the ACA and MCA territories to maintain flow\\nfrom collateral vessels, the patient\\'s blood pressure was\\nallowed to autoregulate up to 180 systolic.  The patient was\\nstarted on plavix on [**4-27**] for stroke prevention, and aspirin and\\ncoumadin were held per the GI consult team recommendations.  The\\npatient\\'s exam remained notable for inattention to the left,\\nminimal volitional use of his left upper extremity, and minimal\\nresponse to commands, following commands intermittently but only\\never simple commands such as open your mouth or wiggle your\\nfingers.  He also remained mute and unable to manipulate his\\ntongue for swallowing.  Given the lack of improvement in these\\nareas despite no clear infarction on his CT perfusion studies,\\non [**4-29**] he underwent a brain MRI to ascertain if there had been\\nany further infarcts.  Indeed, there were areas of\\nsubacute/acute watershed infarction in the right hemisphere.\\nThe likely explanation for worsened speech and oral manipulation\\nwas thought to be due to a combination of remapping of language\\nafter his first left hemispheric stroke and bilateral loss of\\ndeeper hemispheric tissue which controls swallowing.  Given his\\nmultiple infarcts, it was discussed with the family that the\\npatient was unlikely to be able to improve greatly due to\\nprogressive infarctions.  After multiple family meetings\\ndiscussing goals of care with the palliative care team\\nfacilitating, the family felt that it was appropriate to place a\\nPEG tube.  They understood that he might never be able to walk,\\ntalk, or live outside of a nursing facility, and they will\\ncontinue to revisit the goals of care as they assess his\\nimprovement.\\n\\n##GI Bleed: The patient\\'s hematocrit was followed closely while\\nhe was on the floor and remained stable in the 28-30 range.\\nGiven this stability, frequency was decreased to daily checks on\\n[**5-1**].  The patient\\'s sucralfate was noted to be clogging his NG\\ntube, thus the medication was discontinued after discussion with\\nGI consult on [**4-27**].  GI felt that despite his ulcer it was safe\\nto proceed with PEG placement, and they have been consulted\\nregarding this placement.  The PEG was placed on [**2122-5-5**] and tube\\nfeeds were started the next day.  His H/H has remained stable\\nwith Hct of 30 the last few days.\\n\\n##UTI: The patient completed his antibiotic course for UTI that\\nhad been started on the medicine service on [**4-28**].  A repeat UA\\nwas sent on [**5-1**] just to assess off of antibiotics given that\\nthe patient seemed slightly less interactive and was normal.\\n\\n##C dif: The patient was briefly NPO after the NG tube became\\nclogged, and during that time he was given flagyl IV as there\\nwas no evidence seen that he had initially failed flagyl,\\nhowever once the NG was replaced he was started back on oral\\nvancomycin to be completed on [**5-9**] (10 days after completing UTI\\ntherapy).\\n\\n##DEPRESSION: The patient\\'s affect seemed to become flatter and\\nhe appeared less interactive from [**Date range (1) 31775**].  This was may have\\nrelated to his new strokes, however, he was started on a trial\\nof celexa on [**5-1**] given that the decision had been made to\\ncontinue aggressive therapy.\\n\\n##GU: the patient had a foley removed.  His input and output\\nshould be watched and if urine output drops a bladder scan\\nshould be performed and consider a straight catheterization\\n\\n# PPX: d/c\\'d H2 blocker given delerium, heparin SQ, bowel\\nregimen\\n# CODE: full code\\n# CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **]: [**Name (NI) **] ([**Name (NI) 12239**], HCP) [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31776**] (cell:\\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 31777**]), PMD: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Known lastname **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 16171**] Wife: [**Name (NI) **]:\\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 31778**]\\n[**Location (un) **] Health direct line 1051 2581 [**Location (un) 453**]\\n\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n(from rehab list):\\nASA 81 mg Qday\\nPlavix 75 mg Qday\\nMetoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]\\nLisinopril 20 mg Qday\\nIron 325 mg [**Hospital1 **]\\nLasix 40 mg Qday\\nColchicine 0.06 mg Qday\\nRanitidine 150 mg Qday\\nFlomax 0.4 mg Qday\\nSenna PRN\\nFleet prn constipation\\nDulcolax 10mg suppository PRN\\nMOM PRN\\nTylenol PRN\\n.\\nALLERGIES: PCN, beta-lactams, CCB\\'s\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

They did not observe new\\nleft arm weakness although they had difficult testing him as he\\nwas not following commands at the time.  At 10:15am, team\\nobserved that patient was not speaking. He was not following any\\ncommands. Patient was not moving his left arm.  The neurology\\nstroke consult was recalled and evaluated the patient. It was\\nnoted that he was moving his left side but his eyes were\\ndeviated to the right and he had profound neglect of the left\\nside of his body.  He had a CTA and a CTP of the head and neck\\nand there was determined to be ischemia of the right hemisphere,\\nalthough not frank infarction.  He was noted also to have an\\nocculsion of the R ICA in the petrous portion. CT perfusion\\nshowed that there was increased mean transit time (indicating\\ndecreased flow) in the right ACA and MCA indicating ischemia.\\nCerebral blood volume was not decreased suggesting that there\\nwas not completed infarct in this region. CTA neck and brain\\nshowed that the right ICA was occluded from the proximal right\\nICA to the supraclinoid area. It was not clear when this\\nocclusion had occurred - if it was that day or in prior days. It\\nwas discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Neurointerventional Radiology\\nregarding whether to attempt opening the right ICA with MERCI\\ndevice and stenting. However, it was felt that the risks\\noutweighed the benefits. Attempting to open the right ICA could\\nresult in emboli to the right ACA and MCA which could worsen his\\nsituation because his right ACA and MCA vessels were open. The\\nfamily was informed that the procedure was not offered due to\\nthe high risk.\\n\\nThe patient was started on an heparin drip, and his\\nantihypertensive medications were held.  He was started on\\nfluids and transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  He was noted\\nto have guaic positive stools at the time but it was felt that\\nthis risks of stroke from stump emboli outweighed the risk of\\nthe possible GI bleed.  In the unit the patient\\'s exam improved,\\nand he was attending to both sides, and intermittently following\\ncommands.\\n\\nOn [**2122-4-22**] he was noted to have dark tarry stools and some\\nsuction from his NGT was frankly bloody.  This was accompanied\\nby a drop in HCT.  His vitals remained stable througout this\\ncourse.  The heparin drip was stopped, and he was evaluated by\\nGI consult.  He was scoped on [**4-23**] and was noted to have an\\nulcer in the GE junction and a duodenal ulcer.  The GE junction\\nulcer was noted to have a blood clot indicating a recent bleed.\\nHe was also noted to have multiple erosions that GI thought were\\ndue to NSAID use.  They recommended sulcrafate and not to give\\nanti-coagulation.  They also recommended not resuming aspirin\\nbut plavix would be acceptable in 48-72 hours.  The patient Hct\\nremained stable and he was transferred out of the unit on\\n[**2122-4-24**].\\n\\n***NEUROLOGY FLOOR***\\n\\n##NEURO:\\nGiven the need for the ACA and MCA territories to maintain flow\\nfrom collateral vessels, the patient\\'s blood pressure was\\nallowed to autoregulate up to 180 systolic.  The patient was\\nstarted on plavix on [**4-27**] for stroke prevention, and aspirin and\\ncoumadin were held per the GI consult team recommendations.  The\\npatient\\'s exam remained notable for inattention to the left,\\nminimal volitional use of his left upper extremity, and minimal\\nresponse to commands, following commands intermittently but only\\never simple commands such as open your mouth or wiggle your\\nfingers.  He also remained mute and unable to manipulate his\\ntongue for swallowing.  Given the lack of improvement in these\\nareas despite no clear infarction on his CT perfusion studies,\\non [**4-29**] he underwent a brain MRI to ascertain if there had been\\nany further infarcts.  Indeed, there were areas of\\nsubacute/acute watershed infarction in the right hemisphere.\\nThe likely explanation for worsened speech and oral manipulation\\nwas thought to be due to a combination of remapping of language\\nafter his first left hemispheric stroke and bilateral loss of\\ndeeper hemispheric tissue which controls swallowing.  Given his\\nmultiple infarcts, it was discussed with the family that the\\npatient was unlikely to be able to improve greatly due to\\nprogressive infarctions.  After multiple family meetings\\ndiscussing goals of care with the palliative care team\\nfacilitating, the family felt that it was appropriate to place a\\nPEG tube.  They understood that he might never be able to walk,\\ntalk, or live outside of a nursing facility, and they will\\ncontinue to revisit the goals of care as they assess his\\nimprovement.\\n\\n##GI Bleed: The patient\\'s hematocrit was followed closely while\\nhe was on the floor and remained stable in the 28-30 range.\\nGiven this stability, frequency was decreased to daily checks on\\n[**5-1**].  The patient\\'s sucralfate was noted to be clogging his NG\\ntube, thus the medication was discontinued after discussion with\\nGI consult on [**4-27**].  GI felt that despite his ulcer it was safe\\nto proceed with PEG placement, and they have been consulted\\nregarding this placement.  The PEG was placed on [**2122-5-5**] and tube\\nfeeds were started the next day.  His H/H has remained stable\\nwith Hct of 30 the last few days.\\n\\n##UTI: The patient completed his antibiotic course for UTI that\\nhad been started on the medicine service on [**4-28**].  A repeat UA\\nwas sent on [**5-1**] just to assess off of antibiotics given that\\nthe patient seemed slightly less interactive and was normal.\\n\\n##C dif: The patient was briefly NPO after the NG tube became\\nclogged, and during that time he was given flagyl IV as there\\nwas no evidence seen that he had initially failed flagyl,\\nhowever once the NG was replaced he was started back on oral\\nvancomycin to be completed on [**5-9**] (10 days after completing UTI\\ntherapy).\\n\\n##DEPRESSION: The patient\\'s affect seemed to become flatter and\\nhe appeared less interactive from [**Date range (1) 31775**].  This was may have\\nrelated to his new strokes, however, he was started on a trial\\nof celexa on [**5-1**] given that the decision had been made to\\ncontinue aggressive therapy.\\n\\n##GU: the patient had a foley removed.  His input and output\\nshould be watched and if urine output drops a bladder scan\\nshould be performed and consider a straight catheterization\\n\\n# PPX: d/c\\'d H2 blocker given delerium, heparin SQ, bowel\\nregimen\\n# CODE: full code\\n# CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **]: [**Name (NI) **] ([**Name (NI) 12239**], HCP) [**Name (NI) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31776**] (cell:\\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 31777**]), PMD: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Known lastname **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 16171**] Wife: [**Name (NI) **]:\\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 31778**]\\n[**Location (un) **] Health direct line 1051 2581 [**Location (un) 453**]\\n\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n(from rehab list):\\nASA 81 mg Qday\\nPlavix 75 mg Qday\\nMetoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]\\nLisinopril 20 mg Qday\\nIron 325 mg [**Hospital1 **]\\nLasix 40 mg Qday\\nColchicine 0.06 mg Qday\\nRanitidine 150 mg Qday\\nFlomax 0.4 mg Qday\\nSenna PRN\\nFleet prn constipation\\nDulcolax 10mg suppository PRN\\nMOM PRN\\nTylenol PRN\\n.\\nALLERGIES: PCN, beta-lactams, CCB\\'s\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

Abdomen was obese with\\nvoluntary guarding and tenderness in the upper abdomen.\\nRectal examination showed guaiac-positive stool.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  Data revealed the following:  The admission\\nWBC was 21,000 with hematocrit of 33.5.  The bicarbonate was\\n18, BUN 39, creatinine 4.3, ALT 63, AST 74, alkaline\\nphosphatase 569, total bilirubin 4.2 with the direct\\ncomponent being 3.8.  Amylase 35, and lipase 132.  The\\nurinalysis was unremarkable.  Chest film showed free air\\nunder the right hemidiaphragm.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Contrast upper GI was obtained showing a\\nperforation of the first portion of the duodenum.  The\\npatient was aggressively fluid resuscitated.  She was taken\\nto the operating room that evening for laparotomy.  At that\\ntime she was found to have a perforation in the anterior\\nduodenal bulb.  We closed this perforation primarily and\\nplaced [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] patch.  Postoperatively, the patient did\\npoorly.  She was persistently septic in the Intensive Care\\nUnit with a very large fluid requirement.  She essentially\\ndeveloped progressive ascites and findings of end-stage liver\\ndisease.  Bilirubin remained elevated.  She required\\nprolonged ventilatory support.  She developed progressive\\nanuric renal failure.  Consultation with the Renal Medicine\\nService was obtained.  She was maintained on broad-spectrum\\nantibiotics and IV nutrition.  She was extremely somnolent.\\nShe developed progressive severe ARDS.  Fungal coverage was\\nadded to her drug regimen.  Intensive consultations were had\\nwith the son and with the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy.\\nUltimately, decision was made to withdrawal support due to\\nthe patient's lack of progress and wishes that had been\\nexpressed by her, prior to surgery.

Because of the complaints of chest\\npain, her son brought her to our emergency room for\\nevaluation.  She ultimately proved to have a perforated\\nduodenal ulcer.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1.  History of alcohol abuse with alcoholic cirrhosis.\\n2.  Arthritis.\\n3.  Hypertension.\\n4.  History of nephrolithiasis.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  None.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Naprosyn.\\n2.  Lopressor.\\n3.  Procardia.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a blood\\npressure of 95/40.  She was awake, but sleepy.  She appeared\\nuncomfortable.  The chest was clear.  Abdomen was obese with\\nvoluntary guarding and tenderness in the upper abdomen.\\nRectal examination showed guaiac-positive stool.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  Data revealed the following:  The admission\\nWBC was 21,000 with hematocrit of 33.5.  The bicarbonate was\\n18, BUN 39, creatinine 4.3, ALT 63, AST 74, alkaline\\nphosphatase 569, total bilirubin 4.2 with the direct\\ncomponent being 3.8.  Amylase 35, and lipase 132.  The\\nurinalysis was unremarkable.  Chest film showed free air\\nunder the right hemidiaphragm.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Contrast upper GI was obtained showing a\\nperforation of the first portion of the duodenum.  The\\npatient was aggressively fluid resuscitated.  She was taken\\nto the operating room that evening for laparotomy.  At that\\ntime she was found to have a perforation in the anterior\\nduodenal bulb.  We closed this perforation primarily and\\nplaced [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] patch.  Postoperatively, the patient did\\npoorly.  She was persistently septic in the Intensive Care\\nUnit with a very large fluid requirement.  She essentially\\ndeveloped progressive ascites and findings of end-stage liver\\ndisease.  Bilirubin remained elevated.  She required\\nprolonged ventilatory support.  She developed progressive\\nanuric renal failure.  Consultation with the Renal Medicine\\nService was obtained.  She was maintained on broad-spectrum\\nantibiotics and IV nutrition.  She was extremely somnolent.\\nShe developed progressive severe ARDS.  Fungal coverage was\\nadded to her drug regimen.  Intensive consultations were had\\nwith the son and with the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy.\\nUltimately, decision was made to withdrawal support due to\\nthe patient's lack of progress and wishes that had been\\nexpressed by her, prior to surgery.  Accordingly, the patient\\nwas made comfort-measures only and expired on [**10-1**].\\n\\nDISPOSITION:  Deceased.\\n\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:   Cirrhotic liver failure with ascites,\\nsepsis, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome,\\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation, perforated duodenal\\nulcer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 520**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 521**]\\n\\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1779**]\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:  [**2180-3-15**]  08:37\\nT:  [**2180-3-15**]  15:21\\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 13819**]\\n\"]   \n",

Since the previous tracing of same date there is\\nprobably no significant change.\\n.\\nChest radiograph [**2108-1-2**]:  FINDINGS: The tip of the endotracheal\\ntube is 4.4 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses\\nthrough the esophagus, enters into the stomach, but extends off\\nthe field of view of this image. Lung volumes are low. No focal\\nconsolidations are present. The left costophrenic angle was\\nexcluded from view of this image. The cardiac silhouette, hilar\\nand mediastinal contours appear normal. The aorta is slightly\\ntortuous.\\nIMPRESSION: ET tube in satisfactory position. Lung volumes are\\nlow without\\nevidence for focal consolidation.\\n.\\nCT head without contrast [**2108-1-3**]:  FINDINGS: There is no\\nhemorrhage, Edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular\\nterritorial infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation\\nappears well preserved. In the region of the left basal ganglia\\nis a prominent CSF space (2:11). There is moderate mucosal\\nthickening with air-fluid level within the right maxillary sinus\\nand bilateral ethmoid air cells. The frontal sinuses, sphenoid\\nsinuses, and mastoid air cells are clear. Middle ear cavity is\\nclear. The globes and orbits are intact. There are no fractures.\\nRounded hyperdensity along the posterior medial region of the\\ninferior bony orbit (2:5) on axial images is not substantiated\\non coronal reformatted images and likely represents volume\\naveraging with the orbital bone and inferior rectus.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. No acute intracranial pathology.\\n2. Moderate right maxillary and ethmoid sinus opacification.\\n.\\nChest radiography [**2108-1-4**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the\\nstudy of [**1-3**], the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been\\nremoved. The right base is now essentially clear, and there is\\nno convincing evidence of aspiration.\\n.\\nChest radiography [**2108-1-6**]:\\nIMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-3**] and 13.\\nMild relative congestion in the right lung could be due to early\\nedema in the site of previous aspiration, but does not suggest\\npneumonia. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Tiny left\\npleural effusion is seen only on the lateral view. Heart size\\nnormal. No pneumothorax.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nThis is a 68 year old male with a past medical history of\\ndepression who was admitted status post suicide attempt with\\noverdose ingestion of Seroquel, Paxil, and aspirin.  Status post\\n3 day course in the MICU.  Now doing well on the floor and as of\\n[**2108-1-7**], medically stable for transfer to psychiatric unit for\\nfurther management of acute on chronic depression.\\n.\\nSuicidal Ingestion: Mr. [**Known lastname 84199**] was admitted after ingesting a\\nlarge number of aspirin tablets, Seroquel and Paxil. This was\\nconfirmed by toxicology and EGD. NGT was placed, activated\\ncharcoal administered, and bicarb gtt was started. EKG and ABGs\\nwere followed serially. Made NPO and started on IV pantoprazole.\\nEGD revealed a large number of intact aspirin tablets in the\\nantrum of his stomach, which were removed. ASA known to cause\\nspasm of the pylorus, so gastric emptying may have been slowed.\\nErosions had appeared - a likely cause of hematemesis at\\npresetation. ASA continued to rise early in the admission with a\\npeak of 38, which fell to 11 prior to transfer to the general\\nmedicine floor. Bicarbonate was given for resulting acidosis. A\\nmarked anion gap was never present. In regards to paxil and\\nseroquel, patient was monitored closely for extrapyramidal\\nsymptoms and for serotonin syndrome but none were found.\\nMedically stable for transfer to psychiatric floor.\\n.\\nAcute Blood Loss Anemia: Secondary to gastritis from pill\\ningestion, as evidenced by EGD.  Required 1 unit PRBC\\ntransfusion but hematocrits were measured serially and have been\\nstable upon reaching the general medicine floor.  IV PPI was\\ninitially administered and was transitioned to PO.  Lisinopril\\nand nifedipine was restarted and uptitrated to home dose with\\nstable blood pressures.\\n.\\nDepression and Suicidality: Patient is status post suicide\\nattempt with overdose of seroquel, paxil, and aspirin.  Familial\\npredisposition may have played some role.  He will likely\\nbenefit more from combined therapy and medication.\\nAnti-depressive/anxiety medications were held in the context of\\nhaving received an enormous dose.  Was placed on 1:1 sitter.\\nConsulted by social work and psychiatry teams.  Will likely\\nreinitiate antidepressant treatment upon transfer to psychiatric\\nunit.  Patient is medically stable as of [**2108-1-7**] and will\\nrequire transfer to psychiatric inpatient facility for further\\nmanagement of psychiatric issues.\\n.\\nAspiration Pneumonia: Chemical lung injury suspected on basis of\\nclear aspiration of blood and stomach contents.  Due to question\\nof pneumonia on chest radiograph, was started on Unasyn and\\ntransitioned to Augmentin in the MICU.  Was found to develop low\\ngrade fevers upon reaching the general medicine floor, with\\nnegative culture data.  Due to question of drug fever (and\\ndocumented allergy to amoxicillin), patient was transitioned to\\nlevaquin.  Intermittent low grade fevers are likely secondary to\\nresolving URI.  Medically stable for transfer to psychiatry.\\n.\\nAcute Renal Failure: Peaked to high of 1.9.  [**Month (only) 116**] be\\nmultifactorial, with urine lytes nondiagnostic.  Brief period of\\nhypotension, aspirin ingestion, and elevation of CK associated\\nwith rhabdomyolysis may have all contributed to kidney damage.\\nWas given IV hydration with normalization of creatinine.\\n.\\nRhabdomyolysis: Patient found on the floor for unclear duration.\\n Likely muscle breakdown with CK rising to [**2003**].

Due to somnolence and poor gag reflex, he was\\nintubated and admitted to the ICU. NG lavage was performed and\\nrevealed coffee grounds. GI was consulted and he received IV\\nPPI, and one unit of pRBCs. They perfomed upper endoscopy which\\nshowed gastritis, no evidence of active bleeding, and pill\\nfragments (some of which could be collected). Per toxicology,\\nserial aspirin levels were checked with a max of 38. He was\\ngiven IVFs with bicarb, and actived charcoal on [**1-3**]. There was\\nsome concern re: serotonin syndrome but with no symptoms of this\\nand nl QT intervals on serial EKGs. He was treated for a likely\\naspiratin pneumonia with Unasyn, transitioned to Augmentin, was\\nextubated and is now satting well on room air. He has been\\ntreated for renal failure which is resolving. CKs elevated but\\nare now downtrending.

Findings are\\nnon-specific. Since the previous tracing of same date there is\\nprobably no significant change.\\n.\\nChest radiograph [**2108-1-2**]:  FINDINGS: The tip of the endotracheal\\ntube is 4.4 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses\\nthrough the esophagus, enters into the stomach, but extends off\\nthe field of view of this image. Lung volumes are low. No focal\\nconsolidations are present. The left costophrenic angle was\\nexcluded from view of this image. The cardiac silhouette, hilar\\nand mediastinal contours appear normal. The aorta is slightly\\ntortuous.\\nIMPRESSION: ET tube in satisfactory position. Lung volumes are\\nlow without\\nevidence for focal consolidation.\\n.\\nCT head without contrast [**2108-1-3**]:  FINDINGS: There is no\\nhemorrhage, Edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular\\nterritorial infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation\\nappears well preserved. In the region of the left basal ganglia\\nis a prominent CSF space (2:11). There is moderate mucosal\\nthickening with air-fluid level within the right maxillary sinus\\nand bilateral ethmoid air cells. The frontal sinuses, sphenoid\\nsinuses, and mastoid air cells are clear. Middle ear cavity is\\nclear. The globes and orbits are intact. There are no fractures.\\nRounded hyperdensity along the posterior medial region of the\\ninferior bony orbit (2:5) on axial images is not substantiated\\non coronal reformatted images and likely represents volume\\naveraging with the orbital bone and inferior rectus.\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. No acute intracranial pathology.\\n2. Moderate right maxillary and ethmoid sinus opacification.\\n.\\nChest radiography [**2108-1-4**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the\\nstudy of [**1-3**], the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been\\nremoved. The right base is now essentially clear, and there is\\nno convincing evidence of aspiration.\\n.\\nChest radiography [**2108-1-6**]:\\nIMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-3**] and 13.\\nMild relative congestion in the right lung could be due to early\\nedema in the site of previous aspiration, but does not suggest\\npneumonia. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Tiny left\\npleural effusion is seen only on the lateral view. Heart size\\nnormal. No pneumothorax.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nThis is a 68 year old male with a past medical history of\\ndepression who was admitted status post suicide attempt with\\noverdose ingestion of Seroquel, Paxil, and aspirin.  Status post\\n3 day course in the MICU.  Now doing well on the floor and as of\\n[**2108-1-7**], medically stable for transfer to psychiatric unit for\\nfurther management of acute on chronic depression.\\n.\\nSuicidal Ingestion: Mr. [**Known lastname 84199**] was admitted after ingesting a\\nlarge number of aspirin tablets, Seroquel and Paxil. This was\\nconfirmed by toxicology and EGD. NGT was placed, activated\\ncharcoal administered, and bicarb gtt was started. EKG and ABGs\\nwere followed serially. Made NPO and started on IV pantoprazole.\\nEGD revealed a large number of intact aspirin tablets in the\\nantrum of his stomach, which were removed. ASA known to cause\\nspasm of the pylorus, so gastric emptying may have been slowed.\\nErosions had appeared - a likely cause of hematemesis at\\npresetation. ASA continued to rise early in the admission with a\\npeak of 38, which fell to 11 prior to transfer to the general\\nmedicine floor. Bicarbonate was given for resulting acidosis. A\\nmarked anion gap was never present. In regards to paxil and\\nseroquel, patient was monitored closely for extrapyramidal\\nsymptoms and for serotonin syndrome but none were found.\\nMedically stable for transfer to psychiatric floor.\\n.\\nAcute Blood Loss Anemia: Secondary to gastritis from pill\\ningestion, as evidenced by EGD.  Required 1 unit PRBC\\ntransfusion but hematocrits were measured serially and have been\\nstable upon reaching the general medicine floor.  IV PPI was\\ninitially administered and was transitioned to PO.  Lisinopril\\nand nifedipine was restarted and uptitrated to home dose with\\nstable blood pressures.\\n.\\nDepression and Suicidality: Patient is status post suicide\\nattempt with overdose of seroquel, paxil, and aspirin.  Familial\\npredisposition may have played some role.  He will likely\\nbenefit more from combined therapy and medication.\\nAnti-depressive/anxiety medications were held in the context of\\nhaving received an enormous dose.  Was placed on 1:1 sitter.\\nConsulted by social work and psychiatry teams.  Will likely\\nreinitiate antidepressant treatment upon transfer to psychiatric\\nunit.  Patient is medically stable as of [**2108-1-7**] and will\\nrequire transfer to psychiatric inpatient facility for further\\nmanagement of psychiatric issues.\\n.\\nAspiration Pneumonia: Chemical lung injury suspected on basis of\\nclear aspiration of blood and stomach contents.  Due to question\\nof pneumonia on chest radiograph, was started on Unasyn and\\ntransitioned to Augmentin in the MICU.  Was found to develop low\\ngrade fevers upon reaching the general medicine floor, with\\nnegative culture data.  Due to question of drug fever (and\\ndocumented allergy to amoxicillin), patient was transitioned to\\nlevaquin.  Intermittent low grade fevers are likely secondary to\\nresolving URI.  Medically stable for transfer to psychiatry.\\n.\\nAcute Renal Failure: Peaked to high of 1.9.  [**Month (only) 116**] be\\nmultifactorial, with urine lytes nondiagnostic.  Brief period of\\nhypotension, aspirin ingestion, and elevation of CK associated\\nwith rhabdomyolysis may have all contributed to kidney damage.\\nWas given IV hydration with normalization of creatinine.\\n.\\nRhabdomyolysis: Patient found on the floor for unclear duration.\\n Likely muscle breakdown with CK rising to [**2003**].  CK values at\\nthe time of discharge were within normal limits.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n- Paroxetine 40mg QD 30 [**12-14**]\\n- Seroquel 100mg 2 QHS 60 [**12-14**]\\n- Citalopram 30mg PO daily\\n- Ativan 1mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN\\n- Lisinopril 40mg PO daily\\n- nifedipine sr 30mg PO daily\\n- asa 81mg daily\\n\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.
